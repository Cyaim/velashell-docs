# Built-in X Server troubleshooting: remote GUI programs over SSH forwarding

中文:[`../../zh/xserver/troubleshooting.md`](../../zh/xserver/troubleshooting.md)

Everything below comes from real investigations (the first batch on 2026-09-24, `gnome-calculator` — GTK4 + libadwaita — on a remote
Ubuntu desktop install). There are three groups: problems in the **remote environment**, which look the same with VcXsrv / MobaXterm;
**deliberate behaviour** of the built-in X Server — keeping sessions that share one display from seeing into and typing into each other
(see [3](#3-several-sessions-sharing-one-display)); and **defects** in the host and the library, now fixed.

**Remote environment**

| Symptom | Cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The terminal prints `libEGL warning: DRI3 error: Could not get DRI3 device` | Mesa tries DRI3 hardware acceleration first. DRI3 passes file descriptors on the same machine, which is impossible over SSH forwarding | **Harmless**; Mesa falls back to software rendering right away. To hide it, set `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` on the remote side |
| A GTK4 program takes 25 or 50 seconds to show its window, using almost no CPU meanwhile | The desktop portal (`xdg-desktop-portal`) cannot start, and each of the program's D-Bus calls to it waits for the full 25-second timeout | See [1](#1-slow-start-25-seconds-at-a-time) |
| The window shows up, but interaction drops frames and is not smooth | GTK4 renders with GL by default; without a GPU on the remote side it falls back to llvmpipe and sends the **whole window's pixels** over SSH for every frame; GTK4 also makes a dozen-odd synchronous round trips per frame, so the higher the link latency the slower it gets | VelaShell already sets `GSK_RENDERER=cairo` for you in sessions with X11 forwarding (since 2026-10-10; only for programs started from that terminal); for programs started any other way see [2](#2-sluggish-interaction) |
| After starting a GTK program (seen with `gnome-calculator`) the terminal hangs and no window appears locally until you press Ctrl+C; VelaShell's log shows nothing | The same user is logged in to a Wayland desktop on the remote machine. The SSH session has no `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, but its `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is the desktop's directory, which holds the desktop's `wayland-0`; GTK tries Wayland first and connects to it — the window opens on the remote machine's own screen, bypassing X11 forwarding | See [4](#4-the-window-opens-on-the-remote-machines-own-desktop) |

**Deliberate behaviour of the built-in X Server**

| Symptom | Cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| With "Trusted (`-Y`)" unticked for the connection, some remote programs misbehave: they cannot take screenshots, `xdotool` does not work, other programs' windows are invisible | That is what untrusted (`ssh -X`) means: the built-in X Server admits such connections at the SECURITY extension's untrusted level, so they cannot touch trusted programs' windows or keyboard or fake input (since 2026-10-10; before, the built-in X Server did not support untrusted mode and such connections did not forward at all) | Tick "Trusted" for connections that need these abilities; to keep trusted sessions from seeing each other too, turn on "One display per SSH session" (see [3](#3-several-sessions-sharing-one-display)) |
| Typing Chinese with the local input method in an X window, the remote program receives Latin letters; or the remote machine has its own fcitx / ibus and the two input methods fight | With "Use this computer's input method in X windows" (Settings → X Server, on by default) off, keys go to the remote side as they are; with it on, text composed by the local input method is typed into the X program — programs connected over XIM (xterm, Emacs, Java, Tk, Motif, GTK 2/3) receive the committed run whole with the candidate window at their insertion point; others receive it through borrowed keycodes with the candidate window at the last click position | Turn it on when the remote machine has no input method; turn it off to use the remote input-method framework (or set `XMODIFIERS` on the remote side to that framework's — VelaShell does not override a value already set). Takes effect after restarting the X Server |
| While composing with the local input method, the candidate window does not follow the remote program's cursor and the preedit is not drawn in the program's own input box (it is overlaid on the window instead) | The program did not connect to the built-in X Server over XIM: ① it was not started with `XMODIFIERS=@im=velashell` — VelaShell only sets that variable in the shell after connecting (when the session forwards X11 with no display address set, the engine is built-in and the host input method is on; a different value already set is left alone), so programs started from the remote desktop menu, systemd, or `ssh host program` without that shell do not get it; ② Qt 5 / 6 and GTK 4 have no XIM; ③ GTK has `GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus` or similar set; ④ the remote locale is a non-UTF-8 one such as `C` / `POSIX`, which cannot represent Chinese | Check `echo $XMODIFIERS` in the shell is `@im=velashell`; if not, `export XMODIFIERS=@im=velashell` and start the program again; GTK 2/3 programs can use `GTK_IM_MODULE=xim`; use a `C.UTF-8` / `zh_CN.UTF-8` locale. Programs not on XIM still receive committed text (through borrowed keycodes), only with the candidate window at the last click position |
| Dragging a file or text from an X program to the local desktop / file manager shows a no-drop cursor | ① single-window mode (the "window mode" setting is not multi-window) does not take drags — the root window belongs to the remote desktop and whatever is dragged outside the X desktop window belongs to it; ② the program does not support dragging out over XDND (xterm does not); ③ an SSH-forwarded program drags files while its SSH session has disconnected (a notice says the session is no longer connected and the dragged files can't be fetched) | Use multi-window mode; reconnect a dropped session. Dragging out is always a "copy" on the local side; the remote original is never deleted |
| Dragging files out of an X program, the local side takes a while before it accepts the drop; or a notice says the mouse button was released before the files were fetched | The files are remote: VelaShell first fetches them (directories with their contents) into a local temporary directory over that session's SFTP and only then starts the local drag-and-drop — the mouse button must stay down meanwhile | Wait for the "Fetching … item(s) dragged out of …; keep holding the mouse button" notice, then drag to the destination; large files are better moved with the SFTP pane. Fetched files live under the `velashell-xdrag` temporary directory, stay after the target copied them, and are cleared on a later drag-out after a day |
| Dragging out of an X program and back onto an X window shows a no-drop cursor | Intended: those are files just fetched from the remote side, sending them back makes no sense, and the X program that started the drag is still waiting for the release | When dragging between X programs, keep the pointer inside X windows (leaving them turns it into a drag to the local side) |
| On Linux / macOS, programs in a container cannot reach the built-in X Server (`DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:N` and the like) | Since 2026-10-10 Linux / macOS open only the Unix socket by default, not the TCP port (local programs use `DISPLAY=:N` and SSH forwarding uses the in-process connector, neither needs it); with "Also listen on a TCP port" on, the port still listens on 127.0.0.1 only — containers on a bridge network cannot reach it through the gateway address | Linux: mount `/tmp/.X11-unix` into the container and use `DISPLAY=:N` (with host networking, `--network host`, the abstract socket works without the mount); when the container user is not your uid, give it the cookie as well (`xauth add`; the cookie is in your `~/.Xauthority`). For programs that only speak TCP, turn on Settings → X Server → "Also listen on a TCP port" under host networking and use `DISPLAY=localhost:N`, then restart the X Server |
| On Linux / macOS, local programs using the old `DISPLAY=localhost:N` cannot connect; sessions whose connection sets the X11 display to `localhost:N` get `Failed to open display` on the remote side | Since 2026-10-10 the TCP port is off by default, and `localhost:N` means that port | Use `DISPLAY=:N` for local programs (the start notification and the button tooltip show exactly that address); leave the connection's X11 display empty (the built-in X Server is reached through the connector, not a local port) or change it to `:N`; turn on "Also listen on a TCP port" only if you really need TCP |
| On Linux / macOS the X Server starts, but a notice says programs on this computer can't connect to it | The Unix socket could not be created and TCP is off: usually `/tmp/.X11-unix` belongs to another user (on macOS with fast user switching, whoever logged in first created it) or has an untrusted owner. The server then serves SSH X11 forwarding through the connector only (since 2026-10-10; before, the whole server failed to start, taking SSH forwarding down with it) | SSH forwarding is unaffected. For local programs too, have an administrator make `/tmp/.X11-unix` owned by root with mode 1777 (X.Org's standard form), or turn on "Also listen on a TCP port" and use `DISPLAY=localhost:N`. The log line `Unix socket … unavailable` / `not listening on it` gives the reason |
| GTK programs have no rounded corners or shadows; Electron's transparent windows have a black background | Without a compositing manager toolkits do not use visuals with alpha, and windows with alpha are shown opaque (as X specifies) | Settings → X Server → Display, turn on "Transparent X windows" (off by default: windows with alpha cost the system an extra compositing layer; no effect in the single-window modes) and restart the X Server |
| A remote program that pulls the pointer back to the middle (continuous dragging in Blender, CAD rotation, game camera control) still lets it run off on macOS or Wayland | When a program warps the pointer the host moves the system cursor along, so far only on Windows and on Linux X11 desktops; macOS is not done yet and Wayland does not let programs move the cursor | No workaround yet; Windows works as expected |
| Running a full desktop such as `startxfce4` in an SSH session, the window manager does not start, or the desktop window covers the whole local screen | In the default multi-window mode the built-in X Server is the window manager itself and shows desktop windows as ordinary windows | Settings → X Server, set "Window mode" to one large window / no title bar / fullscreen and restart the X Server: the whole X desktop lives in an "X Desktop :N" window and the remote window manager takes over |
| "The X programs froze for a moment" and you want to know who did it | One program's request took too long and every program was waiting for it | Look in the log for `watchdog:` lines (one per item while it is still running, naming the program and opcode) and `slow work item` lines |
| Text copied on this computer cannot be pasted into a remote X program, or text copied in an X program never reaches the local clipboard | The clipboard is exchanged only with **the session that has the keyboard focus**: while the focus is in another session's X window, or in a local window (no X window has the focus at that moment), nothing can be read from or written to the local clipboard | Click the window of the program you want to paste into first, then paste; `xclip` / `xsel` in the same SSH session count as the same session. See [3](#3-several-sessions-sharing-one-display) |
| A middle click in an X program does not paste what was copied locally, and selecting text in an X program no longer puts it on the local clipboard | "Copy on selection" (exchanging X's PRIMARY selection with the system clipboard) is off by default | Turn it on under Settings → X Server → Clipboard if you need it. The cost: whatever you copy locally can then be pasted into any X program with a middle click |
| Remote input tools such as `xdotool` do not work, or complain that the XTEST extension is missing | "Restrict programs from SSH sessions" is on in the settings: programs forwarded over SSH cannot see XTEST, receive no raw key events and cannot change input devices | If you only connect to servers you trust and need these tools, turn it off under Settings → X Server (it is a global setting that applies to every session) |
| Clicking an X window's close button does nothing, and after a few seconds a "Not Responding — force quit?" dialog appears | The program is stuck: it advertises `_NET_WM_PING`, the server pinged it along with the close request, and no reply came within 5 seconds | "Force Quit" disconnects the program — its other windows close too, and unsaved work is lost. A stuck program that does not advertise `_NET_WM_PING` gets no such dialog; disconnecting its SSH session closes it |
| No X window reacts to clicks or keys (typically after the SSH link dropped, the laptop slept or the remote process was suspended while one of its menus was open) | That program still holds a pointer / keyboard grab (or holds the whole server with GrabServer), and since its connection has not dropped, the grab stays | Disconnect that SSH session (or wait for the SSH keep-alive to time out); the grab goes when the connection does. When GrabServer is held for more than 10 seconds, VelaShell's log names the connection (with `user@host:port`). There is no "unstick" entry in the host UI yet |
| An older program reports something like `Cannot convert string "-b&h-lucida-…" to type FontStruct` at startup, and its UI falls back to the monospaced `fixed` | The core fonts bundled with the built-in X Server are X.Org's misc-fixed, cursor, Adobe's 75 / 100 dpi Courier / Helvetica / New Century Schoolbook / Symbol / Times, and GNU Unifont; B&H's Lucida (its licence requires particular notices), Bitstream and other X.Org fonts and scalable fonts are not bundled, so requests for them still get BadName | Switch the fonts in the remote X resources (`~/.Xresources`) to `-adobe-helvetica-*` / `-adobe-times-*` / `-adobe-courier-*`; sizes missing from a family fall back to the nearest one. If you really need those fonts, use an external X server |

**Fixed defects**

| Symptom | Cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typing in a text box of a GTK program (observed with `gnome-calculator`) makes it exit on the first keystroke, and the terminal shows `The program 'gnome-calculator' received an X Window System error` … `BadMatch` … `request_code 93` | Library defect: GTK hides the mouse pointer while typing, and the invisible pointer it uses is a 1×1 bitmap with hotspot (1, 1), on the bitmap's bottom-right edge; the server took the "hotspot inside the image" rule literally and answered BadMatch, and GTK exits on an X error it has not trapped. It has nothing to do with whether the text is Chinese | Fixed (2026-10-12): a hotspot on the right or bottom edge is accepted, and a bitmap cursor with no visible pixel reaches the host as the invisible pointer ([architecture.md](design/architecture.md) §7 "Fonts") |
| With "Compression" on in the connection, a second or two after running a GTK program (observed with `gnome-calculator`) the whole SSH connection drops, the terminal with it; and it happens every time after that | SSH library defect: decompressing a packet stopped as soon as the input was used up, while the decoder could still be holding a few bytes (the partial flush OpenSSH ends each packet with is only a few bits). Large data such as whole-window pixels hits it most easily; the packet came out a few bytes short and the connection dropped with a protocol error | Fixed (2026-10-12) ([SSH spec 01](../ssh/spec/01-transport-framing.md) §6, [SSH architecture](../ssh/design/architecture.md) §11.2.30). On older versions, turning "Compression" off in the connection avoids it |
| After dragging an X window (GTK 4 programs especially, such as `gnome-calculator`) the program freezes for a while before it responds again; the higher the link latency, the longer the freeze | Library defect: every intermediate position of a drag sent a set of ConfigureNotify events, GTK spends five synchronous round trips on each set and was still working through them after the button was released — a one-second drag at a 20 ms round trip froze it for 8.9 s | Fixed (2026-10-10): the next position goes out only once the client has handled the previous move; the same drag is done 0.6 s after release ([architecture.md](design/architecture.md) §7 "Moves during a drag are coalesced at the client's pace") |
| Drop-downs and popup menus of GTK 4 programs have a black border around them (`gnome-calculator`'s mode switcher) | Library policy: GTK 4 popovers draw a transparent shadow margin around themselves with or without a compositing manager, and with "Transparent X windows" off (the default) it was shown opaque, i.e. black | Fixed (2026-10-10): windows whose clients declare their edges not part of the window are shown with their transparency, so the menu has a soft shadow; no need to turn on "Transparent X windows" |
| After stopping and restarting the X Server from the title bar, the remote side reports `Failed to open display` | Host defect: the connector remembered the server that was running before the stop | Fixed ([architecture.md](design/architecture.md), decision log entry "M3: SSH x11 channels go straight into the server through a connector"); on older versions, reconnect the SSH session |
| The remote program exited, but its local window stays open | Host defect: the remote EOF was not passed on to the X Server | Fixed (same entry; [SSH spec 07 §7.5.9](../ssh/spec/07-forwarding.md)) |
| After switching the engine to VcXsrv in the settings, X programs started from SSH sessions that were already open report `Failed to open display` | Host defect: the connector bound when the session opened its shell only knew the built-in engine | Fixed (same entry): once the built-in engine has stopped, x11 channels of existing sessions go over local TCP to whichever X server is running now (since 2026-10-10 only on Windows: other platforms have no VcXsrv, so that loopback port is never our server) |
| Committing a long run of text with the local input method (dictation, long sentences) turns some later characters into other characters over a slow link; with CapsLock on, committed "é" / "ā" come out uppercase; Enter pressed while committing lands in the middle of the text | Library defect: a borrowed keycode was handed to a later character after 200 ms idle, before the client had fetched the keymap for the earlier one; borrowed keys were derived as a type that does not consume Lock; host keys went ahead while the text waited for keycodes | Fixed (2026-10-10): reuse needs 3 seconds idle, one notification per batch, host keys queue behind the text, borrowed keys use the ALPHABETIC type ([architecture.md](design/architecture.md) §7 "Committing text from the local input method"). Very old programs that only speak the core protocol still uppercase under CapsLock |
| With "Transparent X windows" off, some GL programs (GLFW asks for alpha by default: Minecraft, the Dear ImGui demos) show what is behind them or look garbled | Library defect: depth-32 windows were handed to the host as per-pixel transparent whether or not there was a compositing manager | Fixed (2026-10-10): without a compositing manager they are shown opaque, as X specifies |
| With "One display per SSH session" on, turning off "Use this computer's input method in X windows" or "Show where X windows come from" had no effect on the sessions' windows; in one-window mode, closing one session's "X Desktop" window disconnected the X programs of every session | Host defect: the sessions' displays did not get these two settings; closing a screen window always meant stopping the X Server | Fixed (2026-10-10): each session's display gets all host settings; closing one session's screen window closes only that session's display |
| Java (Swing / AWT) programs cannot maximize, or after maximize / resize their contents do not relayout, as if leaving room for a title bar that is not there | Java decides from the window manager's name whether the window manager wraps windows in a frame, and assumes it does for any name it does not know — so it keeps waiting for the frame and ignores size changes | Fixed: the built-in X Server calls itself `LG3D` (a name Java knows does not wrap windows), so maximize and resize relayout as usual ([architecture.md](design/architecture.md), decision log entry "Fixes from the second library-wide review", ⑤). When embedding the library elsewhere, do not change `X11ServerOptions.WindowManagerName`; if you must, verify with a Swing program first |
| Motif / Xaw / Tk-without-Xft programs fall back to `fixed` for every UI font and lay out badly; a default-font `xterm` cannot show Chinese, Greek or Cyrillic | Library defect: the core fonts used to be just five trimmed misc-fixed fonts (Latin letters and box drawing only), and `-adobe-helvetica-*` always got BadName | Fixed: X.Org's whole misc-fixed set (including the CJK `12x13ja` / `18x18ja` / `18x18ko`), Adobe's 75 / 100 dpi fonts and GNU Unifont ship with the library, and aliases follow X.Org's `fonts.alias` ([architecture.md](design/architecture.md) §7 "Fonts") |
| Screen recording / remote desktop (`x11vnc`, `ffmpeg -f x11grab`) does not capture older programs' mouse cursor; cursors such as the pencil or target show up locally as an arrow | Library defect: the `cursor` font had metrics but no glyphs, and XFIXES GetCursorImage returned a 1×1 transparent pixel | Fixed: the `cursor` font is X.Org's cursor.bdf and GetCursorImage returns the real image; cursors with a matching system cursor (arrow, I-beam, hourglass …) still show the system cursor locally, the others show the X bitmap |
| On a Windows terminal server (several users logged in at once), remote programs' windows, keyboard and clipboard end up on another user's desktop | Host defect: deciding whether "another X display is already in use" looked only at whether something listened on `localhost:0`, which may be another user's VcXsrv | Fixed: only a listener process in the current user's session counts; otherwise the built-in engine starts automatically as usual (on another free display number) |

## 1. Slow start, 25 seconds at a time

With `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all gnome-calculator`, the timestamps show two stalls:

```
Gtk-DEBUG:      Failed to get an inhibit portal proxy: ... StartServiceByName for org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop: Timeout was reached
Adwaita-DEBUG:  Settings portal not found: ... Timeout was reached
```

`journalctl --user -u xdg-desktop-portal` on the remote side gives the root cause: the portal front end starts, but its GTK back
end (`xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`) is a GUI program and needs a display. When the user only logs in over SSH and there is no desktop
session, **the systemd user session has no `DISPLAY`**, so the back end cannot start and every layer waits for its timeout.

`GDK_DEBUG=no-portals` and `ADW_DISABLE_PORTAL=1` only get around part of it (some GTK versions ignore `no-portals` at the
"inhibit" call). The real fix is to hand the SSH session's display to the systemd user session so the portal can start
normally. Add this once to `~/.bashrc` on the remote side; it applies on every login from then on:

```bash
# With SSH X11 forwarding: hand this session's display to the systemd user session so the desktop portal can start,
# and GTK4 programs stop waiting for 25-second timeouts.
# Only for SSH logins, and only when this machine has no graphical desktop session, so the local desktop is unaffected.
if [ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ] && [ -n "$DISPLAY" ] \
   && ! systemctl --user -q is-active graphical-session.target 2>/dev/null; then
    systemctl --user import-environment DISPLAY
    systemctl --user --no-block stop xdg-desktop-portal-gtk xdg-desktop-portal 2>/dev/null
    export GSK_RENDERER=cairo    # see the next section
fi
```

- `DISPLAY` may differ on every login (`localhost:10`, `localhost:11`, …), so it is imported again each time, and a portal that
  may still hold the old display is stopped — it restarts with the new display the next time something needs it.
- The `graphical-session.target` check: when someone is logged in to the desktop on that machine, do nothing, so the local
  desktop's portal is not redirected to the SSH display.

Measured: `gnome-calculator` went from about 53 seconds to about 3 seconds.

## 2. Sluggish interaction

GTK4 renders with GL by default. Over SSH forwarding Mesa has no GPU, falls back to llvmpipe on the remote CPU, and sends the
**whole window's** pixels with PutImage — even a mouse passing over one button costs a full frame. With cairo rendering only the
changed parts are sent:

| Remote rendering | Mouse moving over buttons for 3 seconds | Per frame |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default (GL → llvmpipe) | about 114 MB, about 39 MB/s | about 745 KB (whole-window pixels) |
| `GSK_RENDERER=cairo` | about 2.9 MB, about 1 MB/s | about 18 KB |

(`gnome-calculator` window 365×509; end-to-end measurement: an Ubuntu 24.04 sshd in Docker, forwarded through VelaShell.Ssh's X11
forwarding into the built-in X Server.)

The X Server cannot choose the renderer for the client — Mesa's software EGL works with the core protocol alone — so setting
`GSK_RENDERER=cairo` is a remote-side setting. Since 2026-10-10 VelaShell sets it for you after connecting in sessions with X11 forwarding (in
the same silent injection as `XMODIFIERS`; an existing value is kept — to use GL, set it yourself in the remote rc first, e.g.
`export GSK_RENDERER=ngl`); programs started from the remote desktop's menu, systemd, `ssh host program` and other ways that bypass that
terminal do not get it and rely on the `~/.bashrc` snippet above. The same click is 0.15 MB with cairo and 29 MB with GL; opening the mode
drop-down is 3.6 MB versus 11 MB.

With the renderer switched, part of the slowness remains in GTK 4 itself: its X11 backend recomputes the toplevel's size on every frame —
querying the window position (GetGeometry, TranslateCoordinates), reading `_NET_WORKAREA` and `_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP` on the root window and
writing `WM_NORMAL_HINTS`, about sixteen synchronous round trips per frame, the same against any X server (VcXsrv, MobaXterm, Xorg). At one or
two milliseconds per round trip on a LAN this hardly matters; on a link with tens of milliseconds of latency GTK 4 animations drop to a few
frames per second. For such links whole-screen remoting (remote desktop / VNC) is the better choice. The "frozen after releasing a drag"
symptom is a different matter and has been fixed (see "Fixed defects" in the table above).

## 3. Several sessions sharing one display

The built-in X Server has a single display (`:N`), and every SSH session with X11 forwarding connects to it. That is exactly what
trusted X11 forwarding means: programs on the same display can see each other's windows, read the clipboard and inject input into
other windows — a compromised remote machine can, through its forwarding, operate X programs from other sessions.
**Do not enable X11 forwarding for servers you do not trust.**

Within that, the built-in X Server tightens a few things (details in [architecture.md](design/architecture.md) §7, "Several sessions
sharing one display — what is tightened"):

- **The clipboard is exchanged only with the session that has the keyboard focus**: what you copy locally can be read only by that
  session (`xclip` / `xsel` in the same SSH session included), and only copies from that session reach the local clipboard; while the
  focus is in a local window nobody can read it. The description of "Enable clipboard" on the settings page says so.
  The sessions' clipboards are isolated from each other: one session can neither see nor read what was copied in another. To copy and paste
  across sessions, copy in A as usual, click a window of B and paste — the content goes through the local clipboard.
- **"Copy on selection" is off by default** (Settings → X Server → Clipboard): when it is on, whatever you copy locally can be pasted
  into any X program with a middle click.
- **"Restrict programs from SSH sessions"** (Settings → X Server → Security, shown only with the built-in engine, off by default): when on, programs
  forwarded over SSH cannot simulate input (XTEST), cannot listen to every key typed in X windows, and cannot change input devices.
  Recommended when connecting to servers you do not fully trust; tools such as `xdotool` on those servers stop working.
- **Remote programs cannot jump to the front by themselves**: when one asks for its window to be activated, that is honoured only if it
  was caused by what you just did in an X window; otherwise the taskbar entry just flashes. Menus and "always on top" windows stay on top
  only while you are using an X window and drop behind when you return to a local window — so the keys of a sudo password typed in a
  terminal cannot be taken by a remote window that jumped to the front.
- **A window manager started by mistake on a remote machine** (openbox, xfwm4…) cannot take over the other sessions' windows: the built-in
  X Server holds the window manager's place itself. (Except in one-window mode, where the remote side is meant to be the window manager; see
  the "full desktop" row in the table above.)
- **Untrusted forwarding** (connections with "Trusted" unticked, supported by the built-in X Server since 2026-10-10): such sessions' programs
  cannot touch trusted programs' windows, keyboard or clipboard, or fake input; nor can they read text committed with the local input method into
  trusted programs (the borrowed keycodes look empty to them).
- **One display per SSH session** (Settings → X Server → Security, only shown with the built-in engine, off by default, since 2026-10-10): when on,
  programs from different SSH sessions get separate displays, so even trusted sessions cannot see, read or inject into each other; X programs on
  this computer keep using the shared display. The cost is a little memory and a thread per session. In one-window mode each session gets an
  "X Desktop user@host:22" window; closing it disconnects only that session's X programs (after asking when programs are connected), and other
  sessions are unaffected.
- **Show where X windows come from** (Settings → X Server → Display, on by default): titles, taskbar entries and tray tooltips of windows
  forwarded over SSH start with `user@host:port`, and changing it applies immediately. Windows that draw their own title bar (GTK client-side
  decorations, Electron) have no system title bar, so the source shows only in the taskbar.

## 4. The window opens on the remote machine's own desktop

When the same user is logged in to a Wayland desktop on the remote machine (for example a VM with Ubuntu Desktop that logs in
automatically at boot), a GTK program started over SSH leaves the terminal hanging while no window appears locally. To confirm:

```bash
ls $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR | grep wayland                              # wayland-0 present: this user has a Wayland desktop open on that machine
systemctl --user is-active graphical-session.target             # active
WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 gnome-calculator 2>&1 | grep -m1 wl_display     # any output: the program talks Wayland, not the forwarded X11 display
```

The SSH session has no `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, but at login its `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set to the same directory as the desktop's
(`/run/user/<uid>`). GTK tries the Wayland back end first, and without `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` the Wayland client library connects to
`wayland-0` in that directory by default — which is that machine's desktop. So the window opens on the remote screen (look at that
machine's console to see it), the X11 forwarding that `DISPLAY` points at is never used, and the built-in X Server never hears from the
program. VcXsrv / MobaXterm behave the same.

Add this to `~/.bashrc` on the remote side:

```bash
# With SSH X11 forwarding: make GTK programs use the forwarded display instead of this machine's own Wayland desktop (wayland-0).
if [ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ] && [ -n "$DISPLAY" ] && [ -z "$WAYLAND_DISPLAY" ]; then
    export GDK_BACKEND=x11
fi
```

- It only applies to SSH logins with X11 forwarding (`DISPLAY` set), and leaves that machine's local desktop alone.
- It does not conflict with the snippet in [1](#1-slow-start-25-seconds-at-a-time): that one does nothing when a desktop session exists
  (the portal can start anyway), and this one is exactly for that case — add both.
- To try it just once: `GDK_BACKEND=x11 gnome-calculator`.
- When reading logs with `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all gnome-calculator 2>&1 | head`, note that `head` exits once it has its lines, and the
  program is killed the next time it writes to the terminal — before its window has had a chance to appear, so it looks as if it never
  started.
