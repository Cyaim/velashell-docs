# 12 · Security and Threat Model

> **Current-state qualification:** The v1 strength/mitigation tables below are blueprint targets, not guarantees for every current plugin runtime mode. inProcess plugins still exist; `PluginPermissionGate` currently covers `terminal.write` / `session.open` and separate dedicated per-job leases for new upload/download APIs (download SDK unpublished; see §1.2) (see [Capability APIs §2.1](07-capability-apis.md#21-independent-upload-jobs-sdk-211)), not generic grants for other file operations. Dedicated host sudo confirmation does not imply universal Broker enforcement, complete process isolation or auditing. See §1.1 for this change's actual boundaries.

## 1. Trust Model (Layered Statements, No Overclaiming)

| Asset | v1 protection strength | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SSH credentials (password/private key/passphrase) | **Strong**: physically present only in the host process and OS credential store; unreadable through any RPC | D5 |
| Session channels (SFTP/exec/terminal) | **Strong**: reachable only through host capability APIs; every call passes through the Broker; revocable and audited | 06 |
| Host UI and other plugins | **Strong**: process isolation + all UI rendered by the host; no channel between plugins | D1/D6 |
| Plugin-private data | **Medium**: directories partitioned by plugin + secrets namespaces isolated; no mandatory isolation under the same OS user | — |
| Local file system | **Weak (v1)**: access through APIs is controlled by the Broker, but the plugin process can bypass it with direct syscalls | See §3 |
| Network egress | **Weak (v1)**: declaration + SDK auditing; no physical interception | See §3 |

Conclusion: v1's security promise is "**plugins cannot take your credentials,
cannot touch your servers unless authorized, and cannot bring down your main
program**." The claim that "a malicious plugin cannot read your local disk" is
**not valid in v1**. Source trust (signature tiers, see 10) is the gate. This
table is presented honestly in user documentation and on the plugin-installation
confirmation page.

### 1.1 Actual boundaries of this sudo and managed AI execution change (SDK 2.1.0)

- Dedicated `StreamSudoAsync` accepts only target, actual command and non-sensitive options. Source identity is bound from the host manifest; the target comes from the real connection. The host confirms the **entire root command, including pipes/redirections**, every time, including NOPASSWD/cached authentication. Plugin approval Bypass cannot bypass host confirmation. Password entry is not command authorization. The confirmation can pop up asynchronously from Bridge/MCP or no-approval modes, so Cancel is the default button and takes initial focus; a reflexive Enter can only refuse. Control, format, bidi, zero-width and other invisible characters in the command are shown as `⟨U+XXXX⟩` with a count, and multi-line commands or commands over 400 characters show their line count and length, prompting the user to scroll to the end that may sit outside the visible area. The outer command line handed to the login shell is encoded as `exec /bin/sh -c 'eval "$(printf %b "<payload>")"'`, where the payload contains only letters, digits, a few punctuation characters and `\0ooo` escapes that `/bin/sh` decodes itself; a fish login shell (whose single quotes collapse `\\` to `\`) or tcsh therefore cannot rewrite the approved command.
- Only the host's trusted masked UTF-8 dialog collects the password: no default reuse of SSH login passwords or remembering. CR/LF/NUL/control characters and undo are disallowed; controlled buffers/controls are cleared after use. A controlled PTY must confirm echo is off and match a one-time prompt during authentication before sending it. At most three password responses and a two-minute total authentication wait are allowed. Once the command starts, authentication cannot reopen and stdin is closed. Missing UI/unsupported PTY/PAM/OTP fails explicitly, without plugin password prompts, sudoers bypass or ordinary-command replay. The complete raw user-command startup marker must not appear directly in argv that sudo can echo: only the genuinely authorized root wrapper generates it. Policy-refusal diagnostics cannot manufacture Running/Exited or expose authentication-tail content. Real interoperability found and fixed this client-state misclassification, not a sudoers authorization bypass. Random markers cannot defend against an already compromised remote server.
- Passwords and raw authentication-stage content must not enter plugins/models, RPC, history, disk, logs, tool cards or Bridge/MCP. A connection-wide reference-counted lease suppresses **all channel payloads in both directions**, preserving necessary metadata without changing diagnostic settings. Wait for peer CLOSE and the send pump to drain, or connection termination; Dispose returning is not proof of safety. Failed channel opening without a trackable channel conservatively keeps suppression until connection termination. See [SSH specification §9.1](../ssh/spec/08-failures.md#91-connection-wide-payload-suppression-leases-for-sensitive-interactions).
- Managed jobs bind to entry point/conversation/run and fixed sessionId. MCP clients are isolated; scope is rechecked at start/query/completion, while cleanup cancellation is not blocked by revoked read authorization. A background task whose session authorization is revoked by the time its completion is notified gives the model only a "result withheld" Unknown notice, with no output, exit code or target information, and the run pauses with TaskUnknown. **Existing revocation limit:** `ISessionScope` has no Changed/revocation event and group membership has a five-second cache. MCP/Bridge settings reload cancels old runs, but ordinary session-tree group changes without reload are revalidated only at those checkpoints. Immediate revocation while a password dialog is open is not guaranteed.
- In desktop chat and Bridge, plugin approval rejection/missing Handler and host AuthenticationCancelled mark the run denied: model steps, tool calls and background continuation force an `ExecutionDenied` pause, not merely a discouraging string. New user turns require a new run. For external MCP a denial is only that call's result: each client host still uses a fixed scope, but a denial does not seal it, later tools keep working, and whether to stop is up to the MCP client. Background completion notifications frame remote output as untrusted data: it is wrapped in `<untrusted-command-output>` and labelled as command output, not user instructions, and is JSON-escaped so it cannot forge the closing tag. This mitigates prompt injection but cannot guarantee the model ignores text in the output; plugin approval and host confirmation remain the boundary. Stop/entry-point destruction/unload and isolated connection disconnect cancel and asynchronously clean up; cancellation does not prove remote termination. Unknown, missing exit codes and started timeouts without confirmed termination prevent automatic progression/side-effect replay. This is not terminal autofill and does not change existing terminal credential decisions, support su/arbitrary stdin or recover across restarts.

SDK 2.1.0 is officially published and used by the host/AI. Execution RPC, Capability and sudo parameterized regressions have passed, as has the real Ubuntu/Debian sshd/PTY/PAM executor matrix including retries, cancellation and policy refusal. Host sudo-dialog and related localization/dispatch/style gates have passed (not the full UI suite); the all-AI suite and targeted SSH regressions after the latest rejection guard have passed, as have the final strict non-incremental Debug build and targeted regressions rebuilt after style cleanup. A real kernel matrix is not a complete real GUI/plugin-IPC acceptance flow; combined authentication-timeout/late-lease coverage must not be overstated. See [Automation and AI §1.4](11-automation-and-ai.md#14-managed-execution-and-recovery-in-the-ai-plugin-sdk-210) for the release sequence.

### 1.2 Actual background download security boundaries (SDK TBD, unpublished)

- New download `DownloadPermissionLease` is separate from upload leases, confirming plugin, actual session, remote source, final local destination and overwrite policy per job and checking remote read/local write. Default no-overwrite and explicit replacement approval apply. AI Bypass, a save picker, terminal or session-opening permission cannot replace host confirmation; missing UI/prompt means rejection. Revocation cancels pending/active leases, rechecks before commit and redacts subsequent results. Cleanup cancellation remains available, without promising rollback of committed files. This is neither a universal file Broker nor physical isolation against same-user malicious plugin syscalls.
- Safe-commit source currently supports only Windows fixed local NTFS: hold parent handles component by component, reject unsafe linked/reparse objects, exclusively create a random same-filesystem temporary file and commit by handle rename. Default atomic no-replace also protects a destination appearing mid-transfer; explicit overwrite never deletes first. Timestamps target the held temporary handle and legacy synchronous downloading never receives the user's final path. Linux/macOS, UNC and other filesystems/backends fail explicitly. String-prefix prechecks are not presented as race protection, and there is no direct-final-path fallback.
- Check actual length, remote metadata before/after transfer and available digests. Pure SFTP requires neither exec nor a default second full download; detected changes fail, but there is no atomic remote snapshot guarantee. Full bytes are not success: verification, close and confirmed safe commit precede Succeeded. Cancellation is not termination; uncooperative backends first yield Unknown/TimedOut with unconfirmed stop, retaining slots/handles until actual exit. Never automatically redownload or claim rollback.
- Removing the 32/64 MiB fixed AI checks does not remove authorization, download throttling, storage, shared job budgets, model-context or IM attachment limits. Model Stop does not cancel jobs; explicit cancel, panel close/entry destruction, plugin deactivation and authorization reload clean up. Tasks remain owner/run isolated, model terminal results are consumed once and MCP queries explicitly. Paths/errors remain untrusted data. `send_file` cannot consume a download destination or its old same-name file before commit; outbound approval and platform limits remain.
- The official SDK version remains TBD (replace at release). Missing official-package types block downstream builds/download regressions; safe-commit platform or real SSH/GUI end-to-end validation is not claimed. Upgrade central/explicit AI dependencies and minSdk only after publication, without local packages. See [Automation and AI §1.7](11-automation-and-ai.md#17-dual-entry-background-ai-downloads-sdk-tbd-unpublished) for behavior and release status.

## 2. Threat List and Mitigations

| # | Threat | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T01 | A malicious plugin impersonates another plugin in an update (supply chain) | Same public key required for upgrades of the same id; key changes require official-source endorsement; revocation list | v1 |
| T02 | Path traversal inside a package (zip-slip) writes arbitrary files | Extractor allowlist validation; reject `..`, absolute paths, and symbolic links | v1 |
| T03 | Another local process impersonates a plugin connecting to the host channel | Random pipe name + one-time token + pipe ACL (user SID)/socket 0600 | v1 |
| T04 | A plugin impersonates another plugin when making calls | Identity-bound connection; protocol has no identity parameter (05 §4) | v1 |
| T05 | Malicious or corrupt RPC payload crashes the host | Strict MessagePack mode, size limits, protocol fuzzing (P-7), deserialization allowlist | v1 |
| T06 | A plugin bombards the user with authorization dialogs to trick them into clicking | Dialog fatigue prevention (06 §2), publisher trust badge on dialogs, cooldown after rejection | v1 |
| T07 | A plugin injects destructive commands through `terminal.write` | High-sensitivity double confirmation, source badge, rate circuit breaker, non-disableable auditing | v1 |
| T08 | A plugin sends terminal secrets outside the machine (network/AI) | AI gateway egress notice and master switch; network egress in v1 can only be audited by declaration, a **residual risk** documented for users | Partial |
| T09 | The permissions file is modified by a malicious local program to escalate privileges | HMAC (key in OS credential store) + fail-closed invalidation of all permissions | v1 |
| T10 | A plugin exhausts resources (memory/CPU/handles) and drags down the system | Process isolation + monitoring and remediation (04 §4) + hard memory limit through Win Job Object | v1 (Win hard limit) |
| T11 | A crash loop creates harassment | Backoff restarts + Faulted circuit breaker | v1 |
| T12 | A plugin reads host or other-plugin memory | Separate processes, OS boundary; under the same user, debugging APIs could theoretically allow it, addressed by the OS sandbox roadmap | v2 |
| T13 | A malicious plugin directly uses syscalls to access files/network | Accepted in v1 (see §1); OS sandbox in v2 | v2 |
| T14 | Source index poisoning | Whole-index signature + package sha256 + HTTPS | v1 |
| T15 | A dev-mode backdoor that skips signing is abused | Dev loading enabled only for debug host builds or behind an explicit developer switch + persistent DEV badge in the UI | v1 |

## 3. OS-Level Sandbox Roadmap (v2+, Research Item)

Goal: raise the two "weak" areas in §1 to "medium/strong" and make file-system
and network permissions physically enforceable. Ordered by platform feasibility:

| Platform | Mechanism | Initial assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | Landlock (file scope) + seccomp (narrow syscall surface) + cgroups v2 (resources) | Most feasible, kernel ≥5.13 |
| macOS | `sandbox_init` profile (Apple semi-private API, but used by Chromium and others) or an App Sandbox-based helper | Feasible, needs refinement |
| Windows | Restricted token + Job Object as the starting point; AppContainer as the end state (pipe ACLs must be explicitly allowed in tandem) | Largest workload |

Principle: the sandbox is a **capability reducer**, not a replacement for the
permission system. The Broker and authorization UX remain unchanged; the
sandbox turns a "compliance contract" into "physically impossible." Research
starts at M8, beginning with Linux.

## 4. Security Checklist During Implementation (For Review)

- [ ] All capability implementations inherit from the Demand base class (B-7 analyzer enforced)
- [ ] Cross-process exceptions do not carry host stack traces or paths (05 §5)
- [ ] Shared-memory segment ACLs are restricted to the current user; surface reclamation is tested on the plugin-crash path
- [ ] Authorization-dialog wording has passed security review (must not entice users to make "always allow" the default focus; default focus = reject)
- [ ] Audit-log redaction is enabled by default (retain the filename in paths, truncate directories)
- [ ] Permissions files, source cache, and log-directory permissions are restricted (user read/write; no group/other access)
- [ ] Before release, run one "malicious modification" red-team exercise against each of the three official samples (at least one attack script for each T01–T11)

## 5. Development Plan (This Area)

Security work is distributed across the other areas (the corresponding tasks are
listed in the "Mitigation" column above). This area has these independent tasks:

| Task | Description | Dependencies | Estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X-1 | Two security-review gates: before design freeze (walk through this document) + before the M5 release (red-team exercise) | — | 2d each |
| X-2 | User-facing security documentation ("What plugins can and cannot do" page, five languages) | B-4 | 2d |
| X-3 | v2 sandbox research: Linux Landlock PoC (regress all capabilities after PluginHost self-restriction) | M8 phase | 5d |
