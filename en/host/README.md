## Kept in the code repository

| Document | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [`DESIGN.md`](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/blob/main/DESIGN.md) | The design system: colour, type and spacing tokens plus component rules. XAML comments and unit tests **cite its section numbers directly**, so it stays next to the code |
| [`plan.md`](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/blob/main/plan.md) | **What already happened**: the progress log, the current architecture, and the reasoning behind every change |
| [`feature-plan.md`](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/blob/main/feature-plan.md) | **What has not happened yet**: the backlog, candidate features, and the won't-do list with reasons |

> ⚠️ Where a research document on this page says "X is not implemented", **trust
> `feature-plan.md` instead** — research documents record the judgement made *at the time* and are
> not updated as things ship.
