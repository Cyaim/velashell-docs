# Host Layering Architecture

> This page covers **how the host application is layered, which way dependencies point, and what
> lives in each layer**. For *why* it was refactored this way see

## 1. Projects

| Project | Responsibility | May depend on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VelaShell` | Desktop entry point, DI composition root, XAML views, VelaDock docking, global styles and behaviours | every layer |
| `VelaShell.Presentation` | Cross-layer ViewModels, connection / tunnel workflow services | Core, Terminal |
| `VelaShell.Controls` | Reusable controls, design tokens, the bundled Cascadia Mono faces | Core (shared UI contracts only) |
| `VelaShell.Terminal` | VT engine, self-drawn rendering control, X/Y/ZMODEM routing | Core |
| `VelaShell.Core` | Domain models, service contracts, persistence abstractions, protocol engines, localization | **nothing** |
| `VelaShell.Infrastructure` | SSH / SFTP / FTP / tunnel implementations, SonnetDB persistence, proxying, Gist sync, plugin management and capabilities | Core, Terminal (only when an adapter genuinely belongs here) |
| `VelaShell.PluginHost` | Host process for isolated plugins | **SDK contracts only** |

> The desktop entry project is named `VelaShell` (assembly `VelaShell`, `OutputType=WinExe`).
> `VelaShell.App` is a legacy alias that still appears in older docs. Each project carries its own
> `README.md` describing its internal structure and dependencies.

```

Arrows point at the **dependency**. The dashed edge is the "only when an adapter genuinely belongs
here" weak link.

**This direction is a hard constraint.** Two consequences worth writing down:

1. **Core depends on no UI framework**, so domain models, protocol engines and persistence
   contracts are unit-testable without Avalonia — VT parsing, ZMODEM coding and tunnel metering,
   exactly the things that most need regression cover, all live there.
2. **`PluginHost` and the first-party plugins only know the SDK contracts** — no host-internal
   assembly. That is precisely what lets a plugin cross a process and an ALC boundary while the
   types stay identical.

### Why `VelaShell.Controls` is separate

- The design file is mostly **reusable surfaces**, not one-off screens.
- Theme tokens, panel shells, session-tree items, the tab strip, transfer rows and tunnel cards
  should evolve independently of application bootstrap.
- Runtime theme switching is far simpler when token dictionaries and control styles live in their
  own assembly.

## 2. The terminal subsystem

The terminal is **not a control, it is a subsystem**. Bytes travel from the SSH stream to the
screen, and every stage in between can be replaced and unit-tested on its own:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SSH["SSH / ConPTY<br/>byte stream"] --> Router["TerminalTransferRouter<br/>diverted during X/Y/ZMODEM"]
    Router --> Sink["Utf8Sink<br/>incremental decode · configurable encoding"]

    style Router fill:#7c4a03,color:#fff
    style Engine fill:#7c4a03,color:#fff
```

This split is what makes the following tractable: incremental streaming (character- or
line-at-a-time), ANSI escape sequences, URL / error / warning highlighting, selection that does not
hijack `Ctrl+C`, multiline paste, and the whole-line redraw behaviour of Linux progress bars.

The renderer also offers a **line-number / timestamp gutter**
(`Terminal/Rendering/GutterLayout` + `GutterFoldModel`): two independently toggled side columns
with a separator line, fold markers and blank-gap handling, wired to keyboard shortcuts. The
separator line and the fold markers share the fold column but have separate switches (Settings →
Terminal / the gutter's context menu): with only the line on, that column just draws the line and
clicking it never folds; the fold click target is the fold column alone, not the blank gap to its
right (joesdu/VelaShell#586).

**Ten terminal profiles** (vt52 / 100 / 102 / 220 / 320 / 340 / 420 / 520 / xterm /
xterm-256color), each with its own TERM name and Device Attributes reply, live in
`TerminalType.cs`; xterm-256color is the default. TERM is negotiated **at connect time**, so
changing the setting only affects new connections — hot-swapping a live session would just
desynchronise local emulation from the remote capability tier.

## 3. The remote transport stack

### SSH / SFTP

Provided by **[Tmds.Ssh](https://github.com/tmds/Tmds.Ssh)** (fully managed, async-first; it
replaced SSH.NET in 2026-07).

**Library types never leave `Infrastructure/Ssh/`**: `TmdsSshClientWrapper` /
`TmdsSftpClientWrapper` / `ShellStreamWrapper` adapt `SshClient` / `SftpClient` / `RemoteProcess`
to the neutral `Core.Ssh` interfaces, and `TmdsSshInterop` translates library exceptions into the
`VelaSsh*Exception` family declared in `Core`.

> ⚠️ **Identify exceptions across layers by type** (`ex is VelaSshAuthenticationException`),
> **never by `GetType().Name` string**: swapping libraries or renaming a type produces no compile
> error with string matching. This one was learned the hard way — a version matched SSH.NET's old
> type names while the real types had long carried the `Vela` prefix, which **silently disabled**
> auth-failure retry and every classified error message. The tests stayed green because they
> defined their own fake exceptions with the matching names.

**Jump hosts** use the library's native `SshProxy` chain, assembled recursively by
`InfrastructureServiceCollectionExtensions.BuildProxyChain` from saved jump-host profiles
(≤5 hops, cycle-checked, **host key verified per logical hop** — never recorded against 127.0.0.1).

### FTP / FTPS

A FluentFTP backend plus a connection pool and `RoutingRemoteFileService` dispatching per session;
the file browser, transfer stack and rate limiting above it needed no changes. The pool ceiling
**adjusts itself downwards**: if the pool holds live connections but cannot open another
(`421 Too many users`) it clamps to the current count and queues for reuse; if a transfer is pushed
back with `450 Transfer busy` it clamps to 1 and retries that transfer. Trade-offs in
[ftp-client-feasibility-research.md](ftp-client-feasibility-research.md).

### Global network proxy

**Application-wide**, not per session. The single exit is `Core/Net/IProxyResolver` —
**anything new that touches the network consumes it**.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Cfg["Settings → Proxy<br/>direct / system / HTTP CONNECT / SOCKS5"] --> R["IProxyResolver<br/>the only proxy exit"]
    R --> S1["SSH<br/>LoopbackProxyRelay"]

    style R fill:#2d6a4f,color:#fff
    style S4 fill:#5c1a1a,color:#fff
```

- SSH goes through a loopback relay because Tmds.Ssh's `Proxy` abstract members are `internal` and
  cannot be derived from outside; so the first real outbound TCP hop (the innermost jump host when
  a chain is present) is rewritten to a `127.0.0.1` relay. **Host fingerprints stay keyed on the
  original `ci.Host` and are unaffected.**
- **An incomplete proxy configuration raises and refuses the connection — never a silent direct
  connect.**
- **The four modes decide one thing only: how the first outbound TCP hop is made**, covering
  **every outbound channel** (SSH / SFTP / FTP control and data, updates, Gist, feeds, plugin HTTP).
  Inbound tunnels (`-L` / `-R` / `-D`) are a separate layer — do not fold them into these four options.

| Mode | Layer | Covers | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **none** | direct | — | **Truly direct**: never consults the system proxy, never reads `HTTP_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` |
| **system** | OS settings (**a resolver, not a protocol**) | every outbound channel | Resolves the OS proxy into http or socks5; if the OS says SOCKS, use SOCKS5 — never force HTTP CONNECT; unresolvable (not set / bypassed / PAC failure) falls back to direct |
| **http** | application layer (L7) | HTTP / HTTPS plus raw TCP tunnelled with `CONNECT` | No UDP; FTP must be passive, with the data connection on the same CONNECT |
| **socks5** | session / transport layer | TCP (this product does not implement UDP ASSOCIATE) | Does not parse application content; the first choice for proxying SSH / FTP |

- **A system-proxy change needs no restart**: the source is live (on Windows it registers for
  Internet Settings change notifications) and is re-read before every connection. Long-lived
  connections are not switched mid-flight; new sessions pick up the new value.
- The Settings → Proxy page **lays these four modes out as a table** below the form (mode names
  aligned in one column, descriptions wrapping, using the same wording as the dropdown) — one
  wording for docs and UI, so users need not come here.
- **DNS**: over HTTP CONNECT / SOCKS5 the hostname is **resolved by the proxy by default**
  (`ProxyDns` defaults on, i.e. socks5h semantics) so a locally resolved polluted/intranet IP is
  never handed to the proxy; only `none` resolves locally.
- **The proxy applies to the first hop only**: on a jump chain only the innermost host makes a real
  TCP connection; later hops ride the established SSH channel and never re-wrap the same proxy.
- ICMP and the raw TCP used by connection diagnostics **deliberately bypass the proxy**: the
  protocol does not support it, and diagnostics mean *test the direct path*.
- ⚠️ Do not confuse this with **dynamic SOCKS forwarding** (`-D`) — that is a tunnel feature and
  points the other way.

### Port-forwarding tunnels

Local `-L`, remote `-R`, dynamic SOCKS5 `-D` and remote dynamic SOCKS (`-R` with no target). **Both the data plane and the
metering live in the SSH library (`src/VelaShell.Ssh`)**: the host's `Infrastructure/Ssh/LibraryPortForwardHandle.cs` is only a
thin adapter that wires the connection counts, byte counts, the rate in each direction (`Throughput`), the connection snapshot
(`Connections`) and the error events of the library's forwarders (common base class `PortForwarder`) onto `IPortForwardHandle`;
requests carry `MaxBytesPerSecond` (the per-tunnel rate limit, passed into both kinds of library forward options). Before the
library switch, Tmds.Ssh exposed no counters at all, so the host had to listen and relay by itself; that code has been deleted.

| Direction | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Local `-L` | `LocalPortForwarder.Start`: the library listens locally and opens one `direct-tcpip` channel per connection |
| Dynamic `-D` | `LocalPortForwarder.StartDynamic`: the SOCKS5 server in the library (RFC 1928, `CONNECT` with no auth only), with a handshake time limit |
| Remote `-R` | `RemotePortForwarder.StartAsync`: `tcpip-forward` has the server listen, and the library connects the forwarded channels straight to the local target — no more relaying through a temporary local listener |
| Remote dynamic `-R port` | `RemotePortForwarder.StartDynamicAsync` + `RemoteOpenPolicy`: a port on the server acts as a SOCKS5 proxy and this machine connects on the remote side's behalf; the host builds the allow list from `TunnelConfig.PermitRemoteOpen` (a lone `any` → `Any`), and anything outside it gets SOCKS `0x02` |
| Unix sockets | In a local forward each side may be a socket: listening locally via `LocalPortForwardOptions.ListenSocketPath`, a target on the server via `LocalPortForwarder.StartToUnixSocket` (`direct-streamlocal@openssh.com`); a remote forward has only the both-sides-sockets form, `RemotePortForwarder.StartUnixSocketAsync`. The paths live in `TunnelConfig.LocalSocketPath` / `RemoteSocketPath` |

> ⚠️ The relay preserves **half-close semantics**: when one side has been read to the end, EOF /
> `Shutdown(Send)` is sent to the other side, instead of tearing the whole link down; when the link
> breaks, both ends are aborted (the local socket sends RST), so truncated data is never handed over as
> if it were complete. See [`ssh/spec/07-forwarding.md`](../ssh/spec/07-forwarding.md) §2.2 and §6 for the spec.

Details in [tunnel-feature-planning.md](tunnel-feature-planning.md).

## 4. In-terminal file transfer (ZMODEM / XMODEM / YMODEM)

`rz`/`sz`, `rb`/`sb` and `rx`/`sx` are **all implemented from scratch**, spread across three projects
and sharing protocol-neutral contracts:

| Location | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `Core/FileTransfer/` | Shared contracts: `IByteDuplex`, `IFileTransferSink / Source / Observer`, `FileTransferSession / Item`, CRC-16/XMODEM, the ZFILE / YMODEM block-0 file-info codec, `TransferTrace` |
| `Core/ZModem/` | ZMODEM engine (frames, ZDLE escaping, CRC-16/32, `ZModemSender` / `ZModemReceiver`) — **depends only on `IByteDuplex`** |
| `Core/XYModem/` | XMODEM / XMODEM-1K / YMODEM / YMODEM-G engine (fixed-size blocks, per-block ACK/NAK) |
| `Terminal/FileTransfer/` | `ZModemDetector` (spots the ZRQINIT / ZRINIT lead-in in the output stream) + `TerminalTransferRouter` (sits between the bridge read loop and the emulator, hands bytes to the engine for the duration of a session, then resets) + `ShellStreamByteDuplex` |
| `App/Services/FileTransfer/` | Upload file source, download folder sink, progress observer |

**ZMODEM takes over automatically** — its lead-in is recognisable in the output stream.
**XMODEM and YMODEM can only be started manually** (command palette → "File Transfer"): they have
no lead-in on the wire. `sb`/`sx` wait silently for the receiver's `C`, and `rb`/`rx` emit a bare
`C` that is indistinguishable from ordinary terminal output, so any auto-detection would misfire.
Run the remote command first, then invoke the palette entry.

Because the engines need only an `IByteDuplex`, the same path serves SSH, local ConPTY and
plugin-provided protocol sessions (Telnet, serial). Set `VELASHELL_TRANSFER_TRACE=1` (the
historical `VELASHELL_ZMODEM_TRACE=1` still works) to dump protocol frames.

> ⚠️ **Testing lesson**: interop expectations must be hand-built from lrzsz's `zm.c`/`zmodem.h` and
> ymodem.txt. Generating expectations with your own encoder keeps the suite green even when encoder
> and decoder are wrong in the same way — which is exactly how the double-CRC-augmentation bug got
> in.

## 5. Docking and the window shell

### VelaDock (zero third-party dependencies)

It replaced `Dock.Avalonia`; the plan is in [dock-replacement-plan.md](dock-replacement-plan.md).

| Layer | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `Docking/Model/` | **Pure INPC, unit-testable**: `DockWorkspace` / `DockGroup` / `DockSplit` / `DockDocument`; empty secondary groups collapse, single-child splits are promoted |
| `Docking/Controls/` | `DockWorkspaceControl` (renders the split tree as Grid + GridSplitter, **caches views per document**), `DockGroupControl` (tab strip + overflow), `DockTabItem`, `DockDragController` + `DockDropOverlay` (reorder insertion line, cross-group merge, five-zone drag-drop split, Esc cancels) |

Documents *are* the live SSH / local / SFTP sessions; each `TerminalTabView` is cached per document
and reused across tab switches. **Floating windows are deliberately not implemented** — multi-screen
needs are served by the five-zone split.

### Window shell

On Windows and Linux the main window is a **self-drawn borderless window**
(`WindowDecorations="None"`), *not* native chrome; on macOS it uses the system frame and the native
traffic lights instead — see "Per-platform window frames" below.

> ⚠️ This conclusion was earned on **Windows (Win32)**; do not try to revert it there. Avalonia
> 12.x's `ExtendClientArea` / `WindowDecorationsElementRole` managed decorations intercept title-bar
> input on Win32 (buttons stop responding, the window stops dragging), and `BorderOnly`
> additionally drops `WS_CAPTION` (HTCAPTION dragging plus minimise/maximise animations break). The
> whole mechanism is unusable on Win32. The rule is about Win32 only: macOS and Linux use their own
> native mechanisms (next subsection), which do not conflict with it.
> A second trap: `VisualRoot as Window` is **always null** (the visual root is TopLevelHost) — the
> window must be reached through the logical tree via `FindLogicalAncestorOfType<Window>()`. That
> one cost hours of "the title-bar buttons appear to receive no input".

Instead: **self-drawn plus native behaviour restored programmatically.** `Views/TitleBarView` draws
a 28px bar (logo + product name on the left, the global action icon group and self-drawn
minimise / maximise / close on the right); blank areas call `BeginMoveDrag` (the native move loop,
so Win11 edge snapping works), double-click toggles maximise, **Win11 Snap Layouts come from a
`MainWindow` WndProc hook on `HTMAXBUTTON`**, and there is a self-drawn 5px edge / 10px corner
resize grip area (disabled while maximised). On Windows every dialog uses the same borderless mode.

#### Per-platform window frames

A transparent window with a 16px card margin and a self-drawn `VelaShadowWindow` inside that margin
only works on Windows, because DWM adds nothing to a borderless transparent window. A Linux
compositor only knows the whole window rectangle: it strokes it, rounds its corners and blurs behind
it, so the transparent margin turns into a ring of "empty space" around the card; an X11 setup
without transparency (WSLg, for one) paints that margin solid. On macOS `None` has no system shadow
or rounded corners, and transparent windows scroll poorly there, so those windows had to be opaque —
a square rectangle with no shadow. Each platform therefore uses its own native mechanism:

|              | Windows | macOS | Linux, native Wayland | Linux X11 (including fallback from Wayland) |
|--------------|---------|-------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Main window  | Self-drawn borderless (as above) | `Full` + `ExtendClientAreaToDecorationsHint`: native traffic lights, system corners and shadow; the self-drawn window buttons and resize grips are turned off, and the title bar makes room for the traffic lights on the left (not in full screen) and takes the system title bar height (28pt today) so the traffic lights share its centre line | Self-drawn borderless | Self-drawn borderless |
| Modal dialog | Transparent window + 16px card margin + self-drawn shadow | `BorderOnly` + extended client area: system corners and shadow, no traffic lights, opaque window | `BorderOnly` + the `VelaWaylandWindowDecorations` decorations theme: Avalonia draws a 16px shadow and a 1px frame, and reports the real window bounds to the compositor through `xdg_surface.set_window_geometry` | Opaque square rectangle |
| Modeless window | Same as dialogs | `Full` + extended client area: native traffic lights; the self-drawn window buttons are hidden and the title bar makes room on the left | Same as dialogs | Same as dialogs |

Maximised or full screen, the card fills the window with square corners on every platform. The
self-drawn resize grips only appear in the normal state, and only where the system does not provide
edge resizing: the macOS system frame and the Wayland decorations layer both do (the main window on
Wayland is still `None`, so it keeps its self-drawn grips).

**Implementation**: the window constructor calls `WindowChrome.Apply(window, kind[, resize grips])`
(`Views/WindowChrome.cs`), which sets the decorations mode, transparency and background for the
platform (plus the decorations theme on Wayland), follows the window state, and adds style classes to
the window: the platform class `chrome-windows` / `chrome-macos` / `chrome-wayland` / `chrome-x11`;
`chrome-traffic-lights` (the system traffic lights are shown); `window-card-flat` (the card is square
— always on macOS / X11, and on every platform while maximised or full screen); `window-fullscreen`.
The XAML conventions (styles live in `Themes/WindowChrome.axaml`):

- The card carries `Classes="window-card"` and hard-codes none of margin, corner radius, border
  thickness or shadow — a local value outranks a style, so a hard-coded one stops following the platform;
- Children that hug the card's corners with an opaque background (title bar, status bar, left
  navigation…) set no `CornerRadius` and carry `window-card-top` / `-bottom` / `-left` / `-right` /
  `-bottom-left` instead: the inner radius 7 while the card is rounded, square while it is square;
- Modeless windows put `window-caption` on their self-drawn minimise / maximise / close, and a
  `<Panel Classes="traffic-light-spacer" />` at the far left of the title bar to make room for the
  traffic lights;
- **Every window's title bar has one height** (main window, standalone windows and dialogs; 28 since
  2026-09-26): the title bar carries `window-titlebar`, its height is set once in the style, never in
  XAML, and the title row is `Auto`; window buttons are 27×27 squares (side = bar − 1px border). A subtitle or
  action buttons that do not fit move to a row below the title bar (resource monitor, recording
  player, remote editor, connection diagnostics). On macOS, windows that show the traffic lights take
  the system title bar's real height instead (`WindowDecorationMargin.Top`, 28 today) — the lights
  cannot be moved, so the title bar aligns to them. Two exceptions have no window buttons in their
  header, so it is not a title bar and stays 48: the settings window, whose top-left strip is the
  navigation header doubling as the drag area; and the message dialog (notice / confirm / prompt),
  which has no close button and closes only from its button bar or Esc.

Window sizes are written for Windows (including the 16px margin); macOS / X11 subtract 32 from width
and height and Wayland 34 (with the client area not extended, Wayland's `Width` / `Height` cover the
content only and the 1px frame is drawn outside), so the visible card is the same size on every
platform. Where code carries another Windows-based size (the panel window size a plugin declares,
the height cap of the new-connection window), it subtracts `WindowChrome.SizeReductionOf`.
Isolated plugins' windows live in another process (`PluginHostShellWindow` in `VelaShell.PluginHost`),
which by dependency rule does not reference the main program, so the same rules are written again
there in code (including the Wayland decorations theme). `WindowChromeCoverageTests` scans every
window so that a hard-coded frame cannot come back.

**Grounds** (Avalonia 12.1.3 source):

- **macOS**: `None` turns the system shadow off and has no titled style, hence no system corners;
  `BorderOnly` is `Titled | FullSizeContentView` with a system shadow; the traffic lights appear only
  with `Full`, and their position cannot be changed (`ExtendClientAreaTitleBarHeightHint` only
  resizes the title-bar material). With the client area extended, a left-button press is first
  hit-tested against the UI: hitting a button is an ordinary click, and only a press that hits
  nothing, or hits an element with the `TitleBar` role, is handed to the system for dragging /
  double-click zoom — so the action buttons at the top right stay clickable.
- **Wayland**: anything other than `Full` switches permanently to client-side decorations;
  `BorderOnly` draws the shadow, frame and resize grips but no title bar; the shadow width goes to
  the compositor through `set_window_geometry`, which then treats the frame as the window edge (GTK4
  applications do the same). Do not switch a window back and forth between frame modes. Avalonia
  12.1.3's Wayland backend requires `xdg_wm_base` version 3 or later from the compositor; WSLg's
  Weston does not have it, so WSLg always falls back to X11.
- **X11**: `BorderOnly` also makes Avalonia draw decorations, but the X11 backend implements no
  shadow extents and does not write `_GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS`, so the compositor still gets the whole
  rectangle — hence the opaque rectangle. The window handle descriptor is `"XID"`, while the Wayland
  backend provides no handle; that is how the two are told apart.

**Acceptance**: the frame rework itself left every window on Windows pixel-identical to before
(headless render comparison of all windows in both the dark and the light theme; only the
**maximised** state of the recording player and the remote editor changed — they used not to fill
the window when maximised and now behave like the other modeless windows). Afterwards, at the user's
request, every window's title bar was unified at 28, which intentionally changes the title bar height
on Windows too. On macOS the main window, the settings window and the message dialog were accepted
on real hardware (2026-09-26); the other windows use the same mechanism, and the modeless windows'
traffic lights, the traffic-light alignment after the move to 28, and native Linux Wayland desktops
await the next round of on-device checks.

The text menu bar was removed entirely; the command palette (`Ctrl+P`) took over.

## 6. Themes and design tokens

**12 named themes** (7 dark, 5 light) and **16 built-in terminal colour schemes**, paired.

A theme requires only **25 hand-picked seed colours** (`UiThemePalette`, in Core): the surface
ladder, four text tiers, two border tiers, the accent and the semantic colours. The other sixty-odd
tokens (`*Dim`, `VelaHeat1-5`, `VelaGauge*`, `VelaTrace*`, `VelaShell*`, …) are derived by
`ThemeTokenApplier` on the host side by fixed rules.

> **Why derive**: copying by hand goes wrong, and the result is invisible. A mistyped
> `#644AC922` — alpha written at the end — compiles fine and renders as a field of green at
> runtime. Derived tokens are self-consistent by construction, and adding a theme means filling in
> seed colours and nothing else.

- **No colour literals in XAML or C#** — always `DynamicResource` bound to a token (the rules live
  in the code repository's [`DESIGN.md`](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/blob/main/DESIGN.md)).
- The accent colour is a separate override layer; a custom accent auto-pairs its foreground by
  luminance.
- "Follow theme" is an **explicit state**, not an implicit default — the implicit version produced
  "I picked Dracula and nothing happened".

## 7. Persistence

Everything persists through **[SonnetDB](https://github.com/IoTSharp/SonnetDB)**, used as an
**embedded** multi-model database (`SonnetDB.Core`, opened via `Tsdb.Open` under
`~/.velashell/sonnetdb`). Legacy JSON files (`sessions.json`, `settings.json`, `state.json`,
`known_hosts.json`, `quick-commands.json`) are imported once on first run and renamed
`*.migrated.bak`.

**Sensitive fields are encrypted at rest**: passwords, key passphrases and sync tokens go through
`ISecretProtector` (AES-256-GCM plus the local encryption key, ciphertext prefixed `enc1:`); since 2026-10-25 the key
lives in the system keychain on macOS / Linux (the data directory holds only the entry list `~/.velashell/secret.key.ref`,
falling back to `~/.velashell/secret.key` when the keychain is unavailable), and in the DPAPI-wrapped `secret.key` on Windows. The passwords and key passphrases of shared credentials (`shared_credentials`) are treated the same
way; for a connection profile that references a shared credential (`CredentialSource` set), the session repository
clears its authentication material (password, private-key path, passphrase, certificate path) at the moment it is
written — enforced in the repository rather than at each save site, because there are seven or eight of them and
guarding each one separately is bound to miss one.

**Device-local state** (sidebar section collapse, remembered heights) lives in `app_config/state`
and is **excluded from Gist sync**.

Quick commands load through `IQuickCommandRepository`, which owns v1 SonnetDB and legacy JSON
migration, backups, schema validation and the Gist-compatible v1/v2 snapshots — the UI and the sync
service **never touch** the SonnetDB document directly.
Built-in commands come from `QuickCommandCatalog` and are **not stored**; the user's changes to them are
an overlay in the same document (joesdu/VelaShell#555): deleted ones are listed in `HiddenBuiltInIds`,
edited ones are stored as custom commands with the same id, and `QuickCommandCatalog.VisibleBuiltIns`
combines the two for display. The order inside a group lives in the group's `CommandOrder` (a list of
command ids that may include built-ins; empty = default order), and the order of the built-in groups
keeps the stored `SortOrder`. In the Gist snapshot these are added fields as well and the schema stays
v2: older clients ignore them, and pushing again from one wipes them (only preferences are lost, never
commands).

Layout templates (synced through the Gist since 2026-10-25) take a different route: they are read and written through `Core/Layouts/LayoutTemplateStore` (a DI singleton shared by the UI and the sync service, with read-modify-write under one lock) in `layout_templates` / `layout_template_tombstones`,
and neither the UI nor the sync service touches those collections directly. The Gist holds a separate `velashell-layouts.json` with its own `schemaVersion`, merged per template id with tombstones kept for 180 days; the merge rules are in `LayoutTemplateMerge` (a pure function).
They do not "just add fields" like quick commands because an older client pushing the whole payload back would wipe a new section together with its tombstones, while a separate file is out of its reach. Templates, nodes and tabs carry `JsonExtensionData`, so fields added by newer versions round-trip unchanged;
local changes raise `Changed` (automatic sync debounces a push on it), and writes from sync raise `SyncApplied` (the manage window reloads on the UI thread without triggering another push).

### ⚠️ SonnetDB dialect traps

| Trap | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `ORDER BY time` | Requires the `time` column to be **present in the SELECT list** |
| `DELETE FROM measurement` | May be unsupported — the recording store falls back to **drop-and-rewrite compaction** during retention cleanup, so orphaned chunk bytes do not grow forever |
| Time-series tag values | **Empty strings are not allowed** (which is why ad-hoc connections write no `profile_id`) |
| `FieldType` naming | Lives in `SonnetDB.Storage.Format`; it is `Int64`, not `Long`, and values are written with `FieldValue.FromLong` |
| Lock granularity | **A global semaphore is kept deliberately** — document collections and time series share one Tsdb instance (one WAL / storage engine) and SonnetDB makes no internal thread-safety promise, so per-collection locks risk concurrent corruption. The real hotspot was settings reads (once per connection, once per transferred file), solved by a JSON cache in `SonnetDbSettingsService` |

## 8. The plugin runtime (host side)

The host-side plugin runtime lives in `Infrastructure/Plugins/`. **Dual-mode loading:**

    style Gate fill:#7c4a03,color:#fff
    style Caps fill:#2d6a4f,color:#fff
```

The mode is declared by the plugin manifest's `hostMode`; **both modes share one set of SDK
contracts and the plugin source is identical either way**.

**Dependency resolution** follows the plugin's own `deps.json`; only the SDK contracts and the
`Avalonia*` framework assemblies fall back to the host
(`PluginAssemblyLoadContext.SharedPrefixes`), which is what keeps types identical across the
boundary.

**Protocol and workspace extension**: the `Protocols` / `Workspaces` capabilities let a plugin
**register new connection types** — that is how Telnet, serial, Redis and S3 reach the session
tree. A plugin session is adapted to `IShellStreamWrapper` by `PluginTerminalShellStream` and
reuses the entire existing chain: bridge, VT engine, X/Y/ZMODEM, reconnect. Ids are forced to carry
the plugin prefix (impersonation would hijack another plugin's saved connections), and every
registration is revoked on dispose — the precondition for a collectible ALC actually being
reclaimed.

**Distribution**: the `.vpx` package (VelaShell's own plugin package format, carrying a zip payload;
`PluginPackageExtractor` runs three independent gates — an entry-count gate against "a million
empty files", a byte budget against "one entry that expands to ten GB", and path validation against
zip-slip).

Full design in the fifteen blueprint documents under [`../plugins/`](../plugins/) plus the
[status overview](../plugins/STATUS.md).

## 9. How a connection is established

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as User
    participant VM as MainWindowViewModel
    participant WF as ConnectionWorkflowService
    participant Auth as InteractiveAuthenticator
    participant HK as IHostKeyPrompt
    participant KI as IKeyboardInteractivePrompt
    participant SSH as VelaSshClientWrapper
    participant Br as SshTerminalBridge
    participant T as Terminal control

    U->>VM: double-click a session / command palette
    VM->>WF: resolve the profile (jump chain ≤5 hops, cycle-checked)
    WF-->>VM: credentials missing?
    Note over VM,WF: Profiles that reference a shared credential are not asked up front: ICredentialResolver<br/>fetches it at connect time (each jump hop resolves its own), and only a failure or rejection falls back to the dialog below
    VM->>Auth: two-step dialog (username → auth method)
    Auth-->>VM: credentials (returns a copy, never edits the profile passed in)
    VM->>SSH: ConnectAsync
    SSH->>HK: host fingerprint check
    alt first connection
        HK-->>SSH: TOFU record / manual three-way choice
    else fingerprint changed
        HK-->>SSH: manual three-way choice (default) / refuse outright (blocking switch on)
    end
    opt server asks for a code over keyboard-interactive
        SSH->>KI: one-time code dialog (a password prompt is answered once with the saved password, no dialog)
        KI-->>SSH: the code the user typed / cancel = do not connect
    end
    SSH-->>VM: connected (writes audit_log)
    VM->>Br: build the bridge, read loop
    Br->>T: bytes → VT engine → self-drawn rendering
    T->>Br: PtySizeChanged(cols, rows + physical pixels) → live window-change
    VM->>VM: run the profile's post-auth command after its delay
```

A few non-obvious conventions:

- **Connections are initiated only by `ConnectAsync`.** The SSH library (the host's `src/VelaShell.Ssh`)
  never reconnects implicitly; whether to reconnect after a drop is up to the layers above. Tmds.Ssh, used
  before the library switch, defaulted to `AutoConnect = true`, which made *every* SFTP operation silently
  reconnect on its own after a session dropped — dragging in N files meant N implicit reconnects and N
  exceptions — so it had to be turned off explicitly.
- **The bridge read loop does not pre-write `\n` to the shell** (this fixed a duplicated final
  prompt).
- **Local terminal tabs never auto-reconnect** — `exit` is the user's intent. The same now applies
  to a remote `exit`.
- **Closing a "connecting" tab cancels the background handshake** rather than letting it finish and
  linger.
- **Two-step verification goes through `IKeyboardInteractivePrompt`** (a Core contract in the same pattern as
  `IHostKeyPrompt`: infrastructure waits on a background thread, the UI layer shows the dialog; interaction in
  [interaction-and-ui-specs.md](interaction-and-ui-specs.md) §13.2). When there is a UI, `SshConnectionAssembler`
  follows every authentication method's credential with a keyboard-interactive one answered by
  `KeyboardInteractiveResponder`, and turns off the password credential's built-in "also answer" — that looks only at
  the shape (one non-echoed prompt), not the text, and would type the password into the verification-code round. When
  the user cancels the dialog, the assembler throws `VelaSshAuthenticationCancelledException` after the library reports
  its failure; it **deliberately does not derive from `OperationCanceledException`**, or it would be treated as a
  timeout. Without a UI (headless, tests) the assembly is unchanged.
- Connection failures do not crash: authentication / network / timeout exceptions are mapped to
  readable status-bar messages, and `Program.cs` installs
  `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException` / `AppDomain.UnhandledException` as a backstop.

## 10. Composition root and DI

**Every DI registration is centralised in
[`src/VelaShell/App.axaml.cs`](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/blob/main/src/VelaShell/App.axaml.cs)**;
each layer contributes through its own `*ServiceCollectionExtensions`. Services are injected as
interfaces throughout, which is what makes mocking and unit testing practical.

The right way to add a cross-layer service: contract in `Core`, implementation in
`Infrastructure`, registration in that layer's `*ServiceCollectionExtensions` — **never** a bare
`new` in the composition root.
