# Keyboard Shortcuts

Every keyboard shortcut and mouse gesture VelaShell actually binds, grouped by where it applies.

The tables show the **factory defaults**. The "Global" and "Tabs & Panels" groups (except pane focus) and search, clear
screen and zoom in the "Terminal" group can be changed or unbound in Settings → Shortcuts; see
[Customizing shortcuts](#customizing-shortcuts).

## Maintenance rules (read this first)

**This document is not a hand-copied list — it is a projection of the code.**

- The single source of truth is `src/VelaShell/ViewModels/ShortcutCatalog.cs`. Both Settings → Shortcuts and this document read from it;
  for the customizable ones, the factory table is `ShortcutBindings` in `src/VelaShell/Services/ShortcutKeymap.cs`.
- **Every new or changed shortcut must be registered in `ShortcutCatalog` and added to the table below.** This is enforced, not left to memory:
  - `ShortcutCatalogTests.EveryBinding_AppearsInCatalogExactlyOnce` requires every entry of the factory table to appear in the catalog exactly once;
    `MainWindowAxaml_HasNoHardcodedKeyBindings` stops a `KeyBinding` from being hardcoded in `MainWindow.axaml` (users could not change it);
  - `ShortcutCatalogTests.DefaultBindings_DoNotTakeNewTerminalKeys` stops a new factory binding from taking a key away from the terminal (`Ctrl+letter` is a control character);
  - `ShortcutCatalogTests.Doc_ListsEveryCatalogEntry` compares the catalog against this document row by row, and prints ready-to-paste Markdown for anything missing;
  - `ShortcutCatalogTests.Catalog_HasNoUnresolvedResourceKeys` makes sure every string resolves to a translation instead of showing a raw `Sc_Xxx` key in the UI.
- New resource keys use the `Sc_` prefix and must be added to **all five `resx` files** (`Strings` / `zh-Hans` / `zh-Hant` / `ja` / `ko`), otherwise `AllCultures_HaveIdenticalKeySets` fails. Actions that also exist in the command palette reuse its `Cmd_` key so both places read identically.
- Only **real bindings** belong here. A key mentioned in a menu or tooltip but never bound must not be listed (this happened with `Ctrl+N` — hint only, no binding; see settings audit C-10).

## Where bindings live

Find the right place by scope, then come back and update the table:

| Scope | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Global (window level, customizable) | `ShortcutBindings` in `src/VelaShell/Services/ShortcutKeymap.cs` (factory table); the main window registers `Window.KeyBindings` from the current keymap, nothing is hardcoded in `MainWindow.axaml` |
| Terminal context + macOS Command aliases | `src/VelaShell/Services/KeyboardShortcutService.cs` |
| Clipboard / paging / key encoding inside the terminal control | `src/VelaShell.Terminal/Input/TerminalKeyRouter.cs`, `src/VelaShell.Terminal/Emulation/InputEncoder.cs` |
| Terminal mouse gestures (selection, zoom, links) | `src/VelaShell.Terminal/Rendering/VelaTerminalControl.cs` |
| Search bar (matched against the keymap), completion popup, shared-password list, disconnected-state keys | `src/VelaShell/Views/TerminalTabView.axaml.cs` |
| Command palette / file manager / process manager / editor / dialogs | each view's own `OnKeyDown` |
| Esc cancelling a dock drag | `src/VelaShell/Docking/Controls/DockDragController.cs` |
| Explorer multi-select and dragging | `src/VelaShell/Views/SessionTreeView.axaml.cs` (rules in `src/VelaShell.Presentation/ViewModels/SessionTreeViewModel.cs`) |
| AI assistant panel | `plugins/VelaShell.Plugin.Ai/Ui/ChatPanelView*.cs` |

## Platform differences

Global shortcuts default to `Ctrl` on Windows, Linux and macOS alike, and can be changed in Settings; a new binding may
also use Win / Cmd (`Meta`).

On macOS the terminal also has a set of **fixed** Command aliases (`KeyboardShortcutService`): `Cmd+C` / `Cmd+V` to copy and
paste, `Cmd+T` / `Cmd+W` / `Cmd+,` for new tab, close tab and Settings. They do not follow your changes, and `Cmd+C` /
`Cmd+V` cannot be taken by a custom binding. `Ctrl+C` keeps its "send interrupt" meaning on all three platforms and is
never stolen by copy.

## Reading the table

- An "Applies when" of `—` means the shortcut is unconditional.
- `Left Click` / `Right Click` / `Middle Click` / `Double Click` / `Drag` / `Wheel` / `Gutter` / `Command mark` / `Title Bar` / `Tab` / `Tab strip` / `Splitter` / `Connection row` / `Group row` in the key column are mouse gestures, not keyboard keys. `Command mark` is the narrow gutter column that shows one marker per command; it only appears once the remote shell emits OSC 133 marks.
- An action listed on several rows has several equivalent bindings, or variants under different conditions (scrollback paging, for instance, differs between the main and the alternate screen).

## Customizing shortcuts

Window-level bindings **consume keys before the terminal control sees them** (Avalonia matches `KeyBindings` before it
dispatches the key event): a bound combination never reaches the remote program. And `Ctrl+letter` is exactly a terminal
control character, so any set of factory bindings collides with some remote program —
[joesdu/VelaShell#551](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/issues/551) was nano's `^K` being swallowed by the command
palette. That is why these bindings can be changed, or unbound.

**What can be changed**: everything in the "Global" and "Tabs & Panels" groups except "Move focus between panes", plus
search, clear screen and zoom in / out / reset in the "Terminal" group (full list in the table at the end of this
section). Everything else is fixed.

**How**: Settings → Shortcuts; every changeable row has three buttons on the right —

- **Pencil**: click it, then press the new key combination; `Esc` cancels, and so does clicking elsewhere. Modifiers on
  their own do not count; the box shows the modifiers you are holding until you press a real key.
- **×**: unbind. The key no longer triggers anything and goes straight to the terminal.
- **↺** (only when changed): reset to the factory default.

"Reset all" next to the search box drops every change at once. Changes are staged and take effect when you **save
settings**; changed keycaps are shown in the accent color, unbound rows say "Unbound".

**Rules**:

- It needs `Ctrl` or `Alt` (or Win / Cmd); without a modifier only `F1`–`F24` are allowed — otherwise you could no longer
  type that character.
- Fixed shortcuts cannot be taken: `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V` (copy, paste), `Ctrl+C` (interrupt),
  `Ctrl+Shift+Up` / `Ctrl+Shift+Down` (jump between prompts), `Ctrl+Backspace` (delete word), `Ctrl+R` (reconnect),
  `Alt+Enter` (command completion), `Alt+arrows` (pane focus), `Ctrl+L` (SFTP path bar); on macOS also `Cmd+C` / `Cmd+V`.
- If another action already has the combination you are asked first: "Replace" leaves that one unbound, "Cancel"
  changes nothing. Resetting a binding whose factory default is currently taken asks the same way.
- Recording the factory default again counts as no change and leaves no entry.

**Terminal conflict hints**: when the current binding takes a key away from the terminal, a line in the warning color
says so under the row. For the factory `Ctrl+P`: "In the terminal this key sends ^P; to send ^P to the remote side,
press Ctrl+Shift+P" — the terminal sends the same control character for `Ctrl+Shift+letter`, so that combination is the
alternative while nobody has it. The alternative for `Ctrl+W` is taken by "Close all tabs", so that row only says
remote programs never receive it while it is bound. The factory bindings that take a terminal key are `Ctrl+N` /
`Ctrl+T` / `Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+B` / `Ctrl+F` / `Ctrl+-`.

**Where it is stored**: `shortcuts.overrides` in the settings, holding only the changed entries — binding id → gesture,
an empty string meaning unbound. When a factory default changes later, users who never touched it follow along.
Unrecognized gestures and gestures that break the rules above (only possible by hand-editing the settings file) fall back
to the factory default. Settings export / import carries it, and cloud sync includes it when app settings are synced.

```json
"shortcuts": {
  "overrides": {
    "app.palette": "Ctrl+Shift+P",
    "session.close": ""
  }
}
```

Gestures use Avalonia's key names: modifiers are `Ctrl` / `Shift` / `Alt` / `Meta`, digits are `D0`…`D9`, `,` is
`OemComma`, `=` is `OemPlus`, `-` is `OemMinus`. The easiest way is to record one in the settings page and look at the
exported settings.

> `Ctrl+K` is not bound ([joesdu/VelaShell#551](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/issues/551)). Window-level bindings consume the key before the terminal control sees it, and `^K` is kill-to-end-of-line in bash / zsh and cut-line in nano, so the old command-palette alias was dropped; only `Ctrl+P` remains.
