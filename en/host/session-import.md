# Session Import

> plus VelaShell's own connection files (**JSON / CSV** import and export, section 7, joesdu/VelaShell#571), and export back to
> **OpenSSH config** (7.7).

Migrating from another tool happens exactly once, and it happens while the user still knows
nothing about VelaShell. So the default path through this dialog is **open it, glance at it,
click once** — not "first tell me which tool you are coming from".

## 1. What the dialog does

`SessionImportView` + `SessionImportViewModel` (`Presentation/ViewModels/`):

- **Scans every source on open**, presenting each as its own card. The user does not have to
  answer "import from where" first — the machine can look that up itself.
- **Fully automatic by default**: every supported, non-duplicate session is pre-selected and
  the primary button carries the count ("Import 12 sessions"), so one click finishes the job.
  Switch to "custom selection" to expand and tick individual rows.
- **Deduplicates across sources** on `host|port|user`: when the same machine is stored in both
  Xshell and WinSCP, only the first one scanned survives. Sessions that collide with one
  **already in** VelaShell are marked as duplicates too and left unticked (the "skip existing"
  switch can be turned off).
- **One group per source**: imported sessions land in a new group tagged with their source,
  rather than being mixed into the user's existing groups.
- **A result summary**: imported / passwords recovered / skipped.

When a source cannot be detected, its card offers a "browse" entry point — that is how portable
installations, non-default install locations, and config files kept elsewhere get in.

## 2. The three sources

| Source | Default location | Browse | Passwords |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Xshell** | The `Xshell\Sessions` directory under the `UserData` path in `HKCU\Software\NetSarang\Common\<version>`; falls back to `Documents\NetSarang Computer\{8,7,6,5}\Xshell\Sessions` | Folder | RC4 keyed by the current Windows identity (user name / SID, both the 5/6/7 and the 7/8 key schemes are tried). **Never attempted when a master password is enabled** — sessions still import, without passwords |
| **WinSCP** | Registry first, then the default `WinSCP.ini` | File | 0xA3 encoding plus a user-name/host-name prefix check. Master password as above |
| **OpenSSH config** | `~/.ssh/config` | File | **Nothing to recover** — an OpenSSH config file never stores passwords |

Half the code in the first two sources decrypts passwords. The third has none of that; all of
its difficulty is in the parsing rules.

## 3. How `~/.ssh/config` is parsed

`ssh_config` **is not an INI file**. It has no notion of "values scoped to a section": the same
keyword may appear in several blocks, and **block order** decides which one wins. Implement it
the way you would an INI file and it is correct for simple configs and wrong for every real one
that carries a catch-all block — wrong quietly, at that: the imported sessions all look right,
they just all log into the wrong account.

### 3.1 First value obtained wins

OpenSSH's rule is that **the first obtained value for each parameter is used**
(`ssh_config(5)`), which is why the customary layout puts named blocks first and the `Host *`
catch-all last, filling in only what the named blocks left out:

```sshconfig
Host prod
    HostName 10.0.0.5
    User deploy        # comes first, wins

Host staging
    HostName 10.0.0.6  # no User

Host *
    User fallback      # only staging gets it
    Port 2200          # both get it
```

Parsing uses the SSH library's `SshConfigFile` (the host does not keep a copy of its own): it keeps
the **whole block structure** (pattern list + ordered options), and `Resolve` walks every block
matching an alias in file order, keeping only the first value seen for each keyword. Harvesting
keywords while discarding which block they came from inverts this rule.

### 3.2 `Include` expands in place

Where an `Include` sits in the file **decides its precedence**: a `User` inside an include at
the top beats the catch-all further down the main file, and the reverse holds if the include
moves to the end. So expansion happens during parsing, not as "collect every file, then merge".

- Relative paths resolve against **`~/.ssh`** (OpenSSH's rule for the user config), not against
  the directory holding the config file — when the user browses to a config kept elsewhere, an
  `Include conf.d/*` inside it should still mean `~/.ssh/conf.d`
- Mutual includes are contained by a visited-file set plus a depth limit of 16 (the library's
  `SshConfigFile.MaxIncludeDepth`)
- Wildcard matches are **sorted** after expansion; otherwise the same config imports in a
  different order on a different file system

### 3.3 Which aliases count as "a machine"

Only **literal aliases** are imported. Blocks like `Host *` or
`Host *.internal !secret.internal` are templates that exist to back other hosts up; they are not
machines you can connect to. Their options reach the named aliases through the value rules,
which is precisely OpenSSH's semantics — no separate session should be, or needs to be,
produced for them. A negation (`!`) vetoes a match, so an excluded alias does not take that
block's options.

**`Match` blocks are evaluated by the library's rules, and do not apply when they cannot be
decided**: `all`, `host` and `originalhost` are evaluated as usual; `user` and `localuser` need to
know "as whom, and from which machine, we connect", `exec` needs to run a command, and
`canonical` / `final` we do not support — none of these can be decided during a static import, so
that block's options do not reach the sessions (negation is no different: `!exec` that cannot be
decided is still undecidable). They must not be treated as `Host *` — that would apply
conditionally-scoped options to every session unconditionally, and an internal jump host inside a
`Match exec "on-vpn"` would grow onto everything. A `Match` block never produces a session itself.
(Before 2026-09-25 the host used its own parser, which skipped every `Match` block wholesale, so
`Match all` / `Match host` did not apply either.)

When `HostName` is absent, **the alias is the host name** (with `Host build01` and no HostName,
ssh simply connects to `build01`). Without this, a config built on aliases plus a global `User`
would import nothing at all.

### 3.4 Field mapping

| ssh_config | VelaShell | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Host <alias>` | Session name | Literal aliases only |
| `HostName` | Host | Defaults to the alias; `%h` expands to the original alias |
| `Port` | Port | Defaults to 22; out-of-range values ignored |
| `User` | User name | Defaults to empty (asked at connection time) |
| `IdentityFile` | Private key path + `AuthMethod.PrivateKey` | `~` and `%d` `%u` `%h` `%r` `%%` are expanded by the SSH library (`SshHostConfig.ExpandIdentityFiles`, the same expansion used when reading keys to connect; 〔History〕the host used to expand them itself, recognizing only `~` / `%d` and leaving `%h` in the path as-is); relative paths are resolved against `~/.ssh`. **Existence is not checked** — the key may not have been copied over from the other machine yet, and carrying the path into the profile is more useful than dropping it silently; `none` counts as unset |
| `ProxyJump` | Jump-host link (`JumpHostProfileId`) | See below |
| `CertificateFile` | Certificate path + `AuthMethod.Certificate` | `CertificateFile` is set, or a `<key>-cert.pub` really exists on this machine next to an `IdentityFile` (OpenSSH reads that file too) → certificate authentication; nothing is guessed when it does not exist. The paired key: the `IdentityFile` named like the certificate (minus `-cert.pub`) first, otherwise the first one, and with none at all it is inferred from the certificate path by the naming convention. A VelaShell connection uses one authentication method, so extra keys are listed in the import notes |
| `IdentityAgent` | `AuthMethod.Agent` + the connection's agent endpoint | With no key and no certificate → SSH agent authentication: pointing at the default agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, or a path equal to the local `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) → the endpoint stays empty (system default); pointing at another path or named pipe usable on this computer → recorded as the connection's "SSH options → Agent endpoint" (since 2026-10-25; before, not imported); `none` means no agent; an unset `$VARIABLE` or another platform's path (`/run/user/…` on Windows) is not imported and goes into the import notes. With a key / certificate it does not decide the authentication method, but `ForwardAgent yes` forwards exactly this agent (see below). The endpoint is stored only when it is used (agent authentication or forwarding on) |
| `KexAlgorithms` / `HostKeyAlgorithms` / `Ciphers` / `MACs` | The connection's custom algorithm lists | The `+` / `-` / `^` syntax comes across as written (a connection's custom lists use the ssh_config syntax anyway); names this version does not implement are dropped with a note, and a list that is misspelled, or empty once they are dropped, is not imported |
| `Compression` | Compression | Carried over |
| `ForwardAgent` | Agent forwarding | `yes` forwards the agent `IdentityAgent` points at (the system default when it is not set, as in OpenSSH); a path / `$VARIABLE`: the same agent authentication uses, or authentication not through an agent (key / certificate) → carried over with that endpoint; **authentication through an agent while forwarding names a different agent → forwarding is not imported** and goes into the import notes — VelaShell uses one agent per connection, and substituting the authentication one would hand over more keys; another platform's path or an unset variable is not imported |
| `ForwardX11` | X11 forwarding | Only an explicit `yes` / `no` is taken; unset = no forwarding (VelaShell's default). An unrecognized value is not imported, with a note (since 2026-10-25; before, not imported at all) |
| `ForwardX11Trusted` | Trusted (`-Y`) | Only an explicit `yes` / `no` is taken; **unset follows VelaShell's default (trusted)**, while OpenSSH treats unset as untrusted — a host with only `ForwardX11 yes` gets a preview note "imported as trusted (-Y) per VelaShell's default; OpenSSH would use untrusted (-X) here", rather than silently translating OpenSSH's default (the rule the maintainers set on 2026-10-25) |
| `ObscureKeystrokeTiming` | Keystroke timing obfuscation | `yes` / `interval:N` (1–1000 ms) turn it on, `no` off; **unset = off** (OpenSSH defaults to on; not copied). VelaShell's interval is fixed at 20 ms, so an `interval:N` with N other than 20 gets a note; an unrecognized value is not imported |
| `LocalForward` | Local forward tunnel | Each side may be a port or a Unix socket (a side containing `/` is a socket and goes into `LocalSocketPath` / `RemoteSocketPath`). With no listen address it binds 127.0.0.1 (0.0.0.0 with `GatewayPorts yes`); `*` means all interfaces |
| `RemoteForward listen target` | Remote forward tunnel | Two TCP sides, or two sockets (the server listen path goes into `RemoteSocketPath`, the local target into `LocalSocketPath`); only one side a socket is skipped (the SSH library offers just these two combinations and the tunnel service refuses the mix too). With no listen address the server decides (loopback) |
| `RemoteForward [address:]port` (no target) | Remote dynamic SOCKS tunnel (`RemoteDynamicForward`) | The listen address defaults to 127.0.0.1; the allow list comes from the host's `PermitRemoteOpen`; there is no remote dynamic forward on a socket, so that is skipped |
| `PermitRemoteOpen` | Allow list of remote dynamic forwards | One per host, shared by all of that host's remote dynamic forwards, validated by the same rules as the tunnel form. **When it is missing, those forwards are not imported**: OpenSSH then treats it as `any`, but a tunnel's allow list has no default — write `any` to allow everything; `none` and invalid values are skipped too |
| `DynamicForward` | Dynamic forward (SOCKS) tunnel | Listen-address rules as for `LocalForward` |

**Forwards become tunnels of that connection**, always **stopped** (VelaShell has no "start tunnel with the connection" option); start them
from the tunnel panel. With `ClearAllForwardings yes` none are imported; port 0 (a port decided at connection time) is not imported; local
socket paths must be usable on this machine — a leading `~` is expanded, the path must be absolute and within the `sun_path` limit (107 bytes,
103 on macOS), and server paths must start with `/`; anything else is skipped. Lines are parsed one by one, so one bad line does not take
others down with it.

**Every other keyword is ignored**: `ServerAliveInterval` and so on. They either live somewhere else in VelaShell or the host does not support
them yet. What the table above marks as skipped or not imported is not dropped silently: it goes into the row's **import notes** (section 4),
so the user sees what did not come across and why.

### 3.5 Three judgement calls in `ProxyJump`

- **Take the last hop.** `ProxyJump a,b` means "through a to b, and from b to the target", so
  the hop nearest the target is **b**. VelaShell chains jump hosts one profile at a time (each
  profile points at its own previous hop), so taking the first hop reverses the chain. The hops
  further out are chained by a's and b's own profiles.
- **Resolve aliases within the current batch only.** Matching a config-local alias against the
  names of the user's existing sessions would chain two entirely unrelated machines together.
  When the jump host is unticked, or simply absent from this config, the session stays
  **direct** — it still imports, and the user can fill the link in from the connection dialog.
- **Break cycles.** If the config itself describes `a→b→a`, the later link is dropped: keeping
  it only makes the connection workflow's cycle detection throw, and a direct connection is the
  only usable shape left for those two sessions.

Parsing accepts `user@host:port` and bracketed IPv6; alias matching looks at the host part only.

## 4. Credential status in the preview rows

In custom-selection mode each row carries a credential status (six states, all five resx files
in sync):

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Recovered | The password was decrypted; the imported session gets "remember password" and is re-encrypted with AES at rest |
| Password needed | The source holds a password that could not be decrypted (master password, a changed Windows account, …); the session still imports |
| **Uses key file** | The session authenticates with a private key (from `IdentityFile`) |
| **Uses certificate** | The session authenticates with a certificate (from `CertificateFile`, or the `-cert.pub` next to the key) |
| **Uses SSH agent** | The session authenticates through the agent (from `IdentityAgent`: the default agent, or another endpoint usable on this computer) |
| No password | The source never stored one |

The last three states arrived with SSH config support: telling the user "no password" about a session
configured with an `IdentityFile` is **misleading** — it is not missing a credential, its
credential is of another kind.

Below the name and address there may also be a grey line of **import notes**: how many tunnels the forwards became, and the settings
that could not be mapped and were skipped (forwards on port 0 or with only one socket side, remote dynamic forwards without an allow list,
agent endpoints not usable on this computer, unset environment variables, a forwarding agent different from the authentication one, the trust-level difference
when only `ForwardX11 yes` is written, the interval difference of `ObscureKeystrokeTiming interval:N`, unrecognized yes / no values, algorithms this version does not implement, extra keys), one per line.

When a source has a master password enabled, the dialog shows one warning across the top:
**passwords in a master-password vault cannot be recovered; only the sessions come across**.
Unsupported protocols (WebDAV and the like) cannot be ticked and show their original protocol name.

## 5. Adding a source

1. Implement `ISessionImportService` (`Core/Import/`): `SourceKey`, `BrowseKind`,
   `DetectDefaultSource`, `ScanAsync`, `ImportAsync`
2. Write through `SessionImportWriter` (`Infrastructure/Import/`) — group creation,
   deduplication, password re-encryption, `IdentityFile` → key auth and `ProxyJump` → jump-host
   links all live there, as do the authentication method (certificate / agent) with the certificate path, the protocol options
   (`Ssh`: algorithm lists, compression, agent forwarding) and forwards → that connection's tunnels (written to the `tunnels`
   collection through `IAppDataStore`)
3. **Append one line** of DI registration in `InfrastructureServiceCollectionExtensions`

The dialog needs no changes at all: it enumerates `IEnumerable<ISessionImportService>`.

## 6. Privacy and security

- All three sources are **read-only**; no external tool's configuration is ever modified
- `~/.ssh/config` is read **only when the user runs the session import** (what VelaShell reads
  otherwise under `~/.ssh` are keys and `known_hosts`, see
  [`PRIVACY.md`](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/blob/main/PRIVACY.md))
- Recovered passwords are **re-encrypted with AES** by the repository at rest, and "remember
  password" is set **only when recovery actually succeeded** — a password that could not be
  decrypted does not leave an empty one behind pretending to be remembered
- Sources with a master password enabled are never attempted, rather than guessed at with the
  wrong key
- Connection files (section 7) carry no passwords by default; including them requires an export
  passphrase that encrypts the whole secrets section — **there is no option to export passwords in
  plain text**, and CSV never carries them

## 7. Connection files: VelaShell JSON and CSV (2026-10-09, joesdu/VelaShell#571)

The three sources above are about moving over from another tool; this section is about VelaShell's
own connection files — backups, moving to a new computer, handing a set to a colleague, and filling in
two hundred devices in Excel and importing them in one go.

Every entry point is in the explorer: "Import connections from file… / Export all connections… / Save CSV
import template…" in the "More" menu, "Export group… / Import into this group…" on a group's context menu,
and "Export selected…" on the multi-select menu (UI details in
[interaction-and-ui-specs.md](interaction-and-ui-specs.md) §3 and §12).

### 7.1 Two formats

| | VelaShell JSON | CSV |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use | backups, moving to another computer, sharing | bulk editing in Excel, building a device list from scratch |
| Content | the complete connection (`SessionProfile` serialized as is) + its group + the shared credentials it references + port-forwarding tunnels | common fields: id, name, group, protocol, host, port, username, auth, password, private key, certificate, shared credential, jump host, tags, notes |
| Sensitive data | not exported by default; including it requires an export passphrase and encrypts the whole section (7.3) | never exported; an import may carry a `password` column |
| Encoding | UTF-8 without BOM | exported as UTF-8 **with** BOM (without it Excel opens the file in the local code page and every Chinese character turns into mojibake); import is covered in 7.4 |

The export dialog has a third format, **OpenSSH config** (export only, it cannot be imported back; importing `~/.ssh/config` is section 3),
see 7.7.

An export covers the connections the user picked **plus their jump hosts** (all the way up the chain).
Exporting the machines behind a bastion without the bastion itself makes all of them direct connections
on the other computer — exactly the kind that cannot connect. The export dialog's summary has a separate
line saying how many were added this way.

### 7.2 JSON layout

```json
{
  "format": "velashell-sessions",
  "version": 1,
  "exportedAtUtc": "2026-10-09T08:00:00Z",
  "application": "VelaShell 0.9.0",
  "groups": [ { "id": "…", "name": "Production", "sortOrder": 0 } ],
  "sessions": [
    { "id": "…", "connectionType": "ssh", "name": "web-01", "host": "10.0.0.11", "port": 22,
      "username": "deploy", "authMethod": "privateKey", "privateKeyPath": "~/.ssh/id_ed25519",
      "groupId": "…", "jumpHostProfileId": "…" }
  ],
  "sharedCredentials": [ … ],
  "tunnels": { "<connection id>": [ … ] },
  "secrets": { "algorithm": "pbkdf2-sha256-200000+aes-256-gcm", "data": "…" }
}
```

- Enums are written as names (`"privateKey"`), and numbers are accepted on read; key store authentication is written as `"authMethod":"keyStore"` (number `5`) with `keyStoreKey` (key store, key name, machine-level or not, and the public key line recorded when the key was picked; not a secret, plain text); CJK text is written as
  is rather than as `\u` escapes — this file is meant to be read and edited by people
- Connections are `SessionProfile` serialized directly rather than a copied DTO: a copy is one more place
  where "remember to add the new field" can be forgotten, and the symptom is "a setting got lost after export
  and import". The price is that new fields go into the file automatically, so `SessionArchiveFieldTests`
  checks by reflection that every property is classified (configuration / secret / local state) and fails on
  any new, unclassified one — it guards against a new secret field being exported in plain text unnoticed
- Per-session terminal overrides (encoding, terminal type, tab color, tab icon `tabIcon`, …) go into the JSON as-is
  as the `terminal` object; the fixed 15 CSV columns do not include them
- Never in the plain part: passwords, key passphrases, plugin secrets (they go into `secrets` if exported at all),
  and the last-connected time (local state)
- A hand-written file may omit `format` and `id`: a `sessions` array is enough, and entries without an `id`
  are treated as new connections. Comments and trailing commas are allowed
- A `version` newer than this build is rejected outright rather than guessed at; a broken entry only breaks
  that entry (marked red in the preview), not the whole file

### 7.3 Sensitive data

- "Include passwords and other sensitive data" is unticked by default in the export dialog; ticking it
  requires an export passphrase of **at least 8 characters**, typed twice. **There is no "export passwords in
  plain text" option**, on purpose: exported files get mailed around and dropped into cloud drives, and a plain
  password written into one can never be taken back. The option is disabled when none of the connections has a
  saved password. CSV never carries sensitive data
- The encryption is the same as cloud sync's end-to-end passphrase: PBKDF2-SHA256 (200,000 iterations) derives an
  AES-256-GCM key, ciphertext Base64(salt16 | nonce12 | tag16 | cipher). Only the `secrets` section is encrypted;
  everything else stays plain
- On import, a file with `secrets` shows a passphrase box; **it can be imported without unlocking, just without
  passwords**. A wrong passphrase and corrupted data are not told apart ("Wrong passphrase, or the file is damaged.").
  An unknown `secrets.algorithm` (a future algorithm) counts as undecryptable: the file gets one notice and the
  connections still import
- Decrypted passwords are re-encrypted at rest by the target machine's repository with **its own** machine key

### 7.4 CSV columns and how they are read

The exported CSV doubles as the template; the header is always:

`id,name,group,protocol,host,port,username,auth,password,private_key,certificate,credential,jump_host,tags,notes`

| Column | Value | When empty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | connection id (filled in on export; matches the original exactly when imported back) | a new connection |
| `name` | display name | the host |
| `group` | group name | ungrouped |
| `protocol` | `ssh` / `sftp` / `ftp` (auto) / `ftp-plain` / `ftps` (explicit) / `ftps-implicit` / `plugin:<protocol id>` (an id with a dot may drop the `plugin:`) | `ssh` |
| `host` | host name or IP, **the only required column**. `user@host:port` and `[v6]:port` are split too, but only when the matching column is empty; a bare IPv6 address is not split, and a `[v6]` without a port just loses its brackets (profiles store the bare address). A user name / port split this way also applies when overwriting an existing connection (even without those columns) | the row is an error |
| `port` | 1–65535 | SSH / SFTP 22, FTP 21 (implicit FTPS 990); required for plugin protocols |
| `username` | user name | asked when connecting |
| `auth` | `password` / `key` / `certificate` / `agent` / `tailscale` / `keystore` (`systemkeystore` / `cng` are accepted too; the system key store, since 2026-10-25) | certificate if one is given, key if a key is given, password otherwise. Always written on export (even when a shared credential is referenced), so a connection whose credential cannot be matched still comes back with its original method |
| `password` | password, not trimmed (always empty on export) | not stored |
| `private_key` / `certificate` | file path, not checked for existence. With `auth=keystore`, `private_key` holds the reference to the key in the system key store, `cng:<key store>/<key name>` (machine-level: `cng-machine:`); anything else is an error; an overwriting CSV import updates it along with the key column | — |
| `credential` | shared credential name or id; when set, the connection references it and the `auth` columns do not count, **except that `auth=tailscale` takes precedence and ignores this reference**. When the name is not unique locally, the one the duplicate local connection already references is used; otherwise none | its own authentication |
| `jump_host` | jump host: another connection's name or id. Looked up in the file first, then on this computer; when the name is not unique locally, the one the duplicate local connection already jumps through is used, otherwise none (direct rather than wrong) | direct |
| `tags` | separated by semicolons (`,` and `\|` work too) | — |
| `notes` | notes, may span lines (wrap the cell in double quotes) | — |

Rows that give an FTP or plugin connection key / certificate / agent / Tailscale SSH authentication are errors (those protocols only take passwords). Tailscale profiles clear old passwords, keys, passphrases, certificates, shared references and Remember password. JSON writes `"authMethod":"tailscale"` and accepts numeric `4`; even encrypted exports omit old SSH secrets. Overwriting clears material after merging and skips shared-reference resolution before it can fail, while preserving jump hosts and other settings. External Tailscale shared credentials are unsupported: their references are cleared with an explicit warning, the entries are not imported, and matching by ID or name never fills a local credential with their old secrets. Reading is as forgiving as it can be:

- The delimiter is detected from the header row: comma, semicolon or tab (German-locale Excel saves semicolons,
  and cells copied out of a spreadsheet are tab-separated)
- Header names ignore case, spaces and `_ - .`, and common aliases plus CJK spellings are recognized (主机, 端口,
  用户名, 分组…; the table is `SessionCsvHeaderAliases`); column order does not matter, and unknown columns are ignored
  with a notice at the top. A file without a `host` column is rejected
- Encodings are tried in order: BOM (UTF-8 / UTF-16) → strict UTF-8 → the local ANSI code page. The last step is
  for Excel's default "CSV (Comma delimited)" on Chinese Windows, which saves GBK; when the regional format is not
  CJK but the UI language is, the UI language's code page is used
- CSV injection: on export, a cell starting with `= + - @` and the like gets a leading apostrophe so Excel treats it
  as text, not a formula; the apostrophe is removed on import, so nothing is lost on a round trip (names and notes
  may come from someone else's file)
- Problems in a row (empty host or a host with spaces, port out of range, unknown protocol) are marked with their
  line number in the preview without affecting the other rows; trailing empty rows from Excel are skipped

The template ships with two example rows using the documentation range 192.0.2.x (RFC 5737) and names starting with
`example-` — forget to delete them and the preview makes it obvious.

### 7.5 Duplicates and how things are written

- **What counts as a duplicate**: first the id (the same connection: a backup exported here, a CSV edited and
  imported back), then "protocol + host (case-insensitive) + port + username"; when the latter matches several,
  the one with the same name wins. Duplicates within the file are left alone — the user wrote them
- **When a connection already exists**, one of three, "Skip" by default:
  - **Skip**: the local one is untouched. Whatever in the file uses it as a jump host now points at the local one —
    exports carry jump hosts along, and on the other computer that jump host is usually already there, which is
    exactly the most common case
  - **Overwrite**: the id stays. JSON replaces the whole connection, but **the local password and passphrase are kept**
    when the file carries none (not exported or not unlocked), and so is the last-connected time; CSV **only changes the
    columns present in the file**, an empty `password` cell means "leave it" (it is always empty on export), and settings
    CSV cannot express — terminal settings, plugin settings — are kept as they are. "Export CSV → change usernames in
    Excel → import back" depends on exactly this. A local connection is overwritten at most once; a second row in the
    file that matches it is saved as a new one. The row with the same id comes first — it is that connection — so a row
    matching only by host cannot take it, even if it appears earlier. When overwriting would change the host of a local
    connection that has a saved password / passphrase, its preview row warns that "the password saved here will be used
    for the new host": exactly right when a server changed its IP, but a tampered file could use it to send the password
    elsewhere
  - **Keep both**: the file's one is saved as a new connection (new id), and jump-host references to it inside the file
    are redirected too
- In the preview, duplicate rows cannot be ticked in Skip mode (they would not be written anyway, and a tickable row
  would suggest otherwise); rows with errors cannot be ticked in any mode
- **The file's ids are kept when possible**: when an id does not clash with a local one it is reused, so moving files
  between two computers that sync through the cloud still shows the same connection to sync rather than a copy
- **Groups**: by default the file's groups — JSON matches a local group by id, then by name (case-insensitive); CSV by
  name; when nothing matches the group is created after the existing ones, in file order, reusing the file's group id.
  "Put into" can pick a local group or "Ungrouped" instead, putting everything there; coming from "Import into this
  group…" preselects that group. Each preview row shows the group it lands in, and groups to be created are marked "new"
- **Shared credentials** (JSON): one with the same id or name locally is reused and **not overwritten**; only when there
  is none is it created (with its password if unlocked). When the reused local one lacks a password / passphrase (as a
  credential pulled by cloud sync without an end-to-end passphrase does) and the unlocked file has it, the missing items
  are filled in; what is already there is left alone. CSV only references existing local ones
- **Jump hosts**: when one cannot be found (not in the file, not on this computer) the connection becomes direct, with a
  notice; a loop is broken at one link
- Write order: shared credentials → groups → connections → tunnels. Connections reference the first two; the other way
  round, a failure halfway would leave connections pointing at groups that do not exist, and they would vanish from the
  explorer
- Compromises made while writing (jump host made direct, credential not found…) are listed one by one in a dialog after
  the import (up to 15); without any, a single toast reports the result
- The dialog cannot be closed while it is writing (Esc, Cancel and the title-bar × do nothing); it closes itself when
  done. If writing fails halfway the dialog stays open with the reason; part of the file may already be in the store, so
  whether the user retries or cancels, the explorer is reloaded once the dialog closes (the batch edit dialog does the same)
- Files are limited to 16 MB (a CSV of two hundred devices is a few dozen KB; anything larger is almost certainly the
  wrong file)

### 7.6 Where the code lives

The rules are pure functions in `Core/Import/`: `SessionArchiveBuilder` (export scope and content), `SessionArchiveJson`
(JSON reading/writing and secret encryption), `SessionCsv` (CSV reading/writing; header aliases in
`SessionCsvHeaderAliases`), `SessionFileText` (encodings) and `SessionImportPlanner` (matching and the write set).
`Infrastructure/Import/SessionArchiveService` (`ISessionArchiveService`) only loads data from the repositories and writes
the computed result back; the three dialogs' view models live in the host's `ViewModels/` (`SessionExportViewModel` /
`SessionFileImportViewModel` / `SessionBatchEditViewModel`).

### 7.7 Exporting as OpenSSH config (2026-10-24)

The export dialog's third segment, "OpenSSH config" (`SessionFileFormat.SshConfig`, **export only**), writes the selected connections as `Host`
blocks that can be pasted straight into `~/.ssh/config`, so the command-line ssh shares the same list of connections. The implementation is
`Infrastructure/Import/SshConfigExporter`, the reverse of the import in section 3, writing the same keywords the import understands.

- **Scope**: SSH / SFTP only, one `Host` block per connection; FTP and plugin protocols are skipped and counted. Jump hosts come along by the
  rule in 7.1, and `ProxyJump` refers to them by alias.
- **Aliases**: the connection name (the host when there is none), with whitespace and characters that mean something else in ssh_config
  replaced by `-`, and a number appended to duplicates.
- **What is written**: `HostName` / `Port` / `User` / `IdentityFile` / `CertificateFile` / `ProxyJump` / `Compression` / `IdentityAgent` (agent authentication with an endpoint set) /
  `ForwardAgent` (with an endpoint set, the endpoint itself rather than yes) / `ForwardX11` and `ForwardX11Trusted` (with X11 on, the trust level is always written, since the defaults differ) /
  `ObscureKeystrokeTiming yes` (**only when on**; off is not written as `no`: the keyword arrived in OpenSSH 9.5 and older versions reject a whole config with an unknown keyword, at the cost that a newer ssh then applies its own default, on) /
  the four algorithm lists / the three kinds of forward. A connection using system key store authentication gets a `# cng:… (VelaShell: a Windows key store key; OpenSSH cannot use it as an IdentityFile)` comment instead of an `IdentityFile`. Connections that use a shared credential get the credential's material
  (a user name set on the connection wins, as when connecting). Paths under the home directory are written as `~/…`, so they still resolve on
  another machine.
- **"Allow legacy algorithms"** has no ssh_config switch: a category without a custom list is written as `+legacy algorithms`; one written with
  `+` is merged into a single line; one written with `-` / `^` (OpenSSH allows only one prefix per line) is written as the computed full list.
- **Forwards**: tunnels are written back as the three forward keywords, with the socket side as a path; a remote dynamic tunnel becomes a
  target-less `RemoteForward` and **is always written together with `PermitRemoteOpen`** — without it OpenSSH allows `any`, so one missing
  line would widen a tightened list to everything. A host can carry only one `PermitRemoteOpen`: remote dynamic tunnels whose list differs from
  the first one, remote dynamic tunnels with an empty list, and remote forwards with only one socket side are written as
  `# <the original line>  (VelaShell: <reason in English>)` comments instead of taking the union (a union would loosen the stricter one); the
  comments are not read back on import.
- **No passwords or passphrases** (ssh_config never holds them); UTF-8 without a BOM, `.conf` by default. The completion message says how many
  connections were exported and that no passwords are included.

## 8. Not done yet

- Exporting back to `~/.ssh/config` is done (7.7); `known_hosts` import and export live under Settings → Security & Audit → Trusted hosts (see
  the twentieth batch in [settings-audit.md](settings-audit.md)).

The rest is scheduled in [`feature-plan.md`](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/blob/main/feature-plan.md) in the code repository.
