# VelaShell Settings UI Functional Audit and Restructuring Checklist

> Audit scope: settings model, settings pages, persistence services, and primary runtime consumers  
> Audit objectives: identify functional duplication, unclear semantics, runtime conflicts, ineffective settings, and missing settings, and provide an actionable grouping plan  
> Status note: This document is a remediation ledger. The first remediation batch (Phases 1 to 3 and conditional visibility) was completed on 2026-07-11, and the "Status" columns in all tables have been synchronized. Source line numbers are snapshots from the audit and may have shifted after remediation.

## 1. Executive Summary

The current Settings Center contains 9 top-level entries and approximately 80 visible settings or management functions. The main issue is not the number of settings itself, but the following:

1. `BellMode` and `VisualBell` both control the terminal bell, creating a real runtime conflict. (Fixed)
2. The automatic reconnect count, default values, and "Show hidden files" settings have multiple sources of state. (Fixed)
3. The UI descriptions and actual behavior of export, language switching, and close confirmation are not fully consistent. (Fixed except for localization)
4. More than 12 unimplemented settings occupied the interface long-term as disabled controls. (All hidden or removed)
5. "General" handles startup, connections, notifications, security, logging, updates, and several other areas, and has become a miscellaneous collection. (Partially mitigated: the update group is hidden and reconnect settings have been grouped; overall IA restructuring remains pending)
6. Key Management and Snippets are functional management tools, not application preferences. (Pending)
7. Terminal colors are under "Appearance", while terminal font, encoding, cursor, and other settings are under "Terminal", requiring users to search across pages for settings for the same object. (Pending)

### 1.1 Priority Definitions

| Priority | Meaning | Handling requirement |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | A confirmed security risk or runtime conflict | Handle first to prevent further incorrect configurations |
| P1 | Clearly misleading behavior, inconsistent state, or a critical experience defect | Recommended for the next remediation release |
| P2 | Information architecture, discoverability, or advanced experience issue | Can be handled together during settings UI restructuring |
| P3 | Optional enhancement | Include in product planning evaluation |

## 2. Confirmed Conflicts and Inconsistencies

| ID | Priority | Affected function | Problem type | Current behavior | Recommended handling | Source evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-01 | P0 | Terminal Bell, visual flash | Actual runtime conflict | `VisualBell=true` overrides "system alert sound" and "silent", because the actual condition is `VisualBell \|\| BellMode == "visual"` | Remove the standalone `VisualBell`; retain only the three-state Bell setting: "system alert sound / visual flash / no alert"; migrate old configuration | `AppSettings.cs:222,226`;`VelaTerminalControl.cs:217-220,472`;`MainWindowViewModel.cs:1565-1566` | ✅ Done (2026-07-11): `BellMode` is now the sole authority; `VisualBell` is retained only as a migration slot. When the two settings services load, `AppSettings.Normalize()` migrates them to `BellMode=visual` and clears the old value; the terminal control property and independent settings page toggle have been removed |
| C-02 | P1 | Maximum retries | Multiple runtime authorities | `General.MaxRetries` in settings controls part of the automatic reconnect flow, but `TerminalTabViewModel` still hardcodes the maximum number of attempts as 3 | Rename to "Maximum automatic reconnect attempts" and make all automatic reconnect paths read the same value | `AppSettings.cs:65`;`MainWindowViewModel.cs:1325`;`TerminalTabViewModel.cs:297` | ✅ Done: `TerminalTabViewModel.MaxReconnectAttempts` is now a writable property supplied by the host according to the setting during disconnect handling; the UI was renamed "Maximum automatic reconnect attempts" and moved into the subordinate "Behavior > Automatic reconnect" position (range 1 to 20) |
| C-03 | P1 | Confirm before closing, minimize to tray | Unspecified priority | When minimize to tray is enabled, closing the window first minimizes it and does not enter the close confirmation flow | Rename to "Confirm before exiting the application" and explain in the description that it is not triggered when minimizing to tray | `AppSettings.cs:55,78`;`MainWindow.axaml.cs:297-310` | ✅ Done: renamed "Confirm before exiting the application"; the description clarifies tray precedence; the tray item description also says that the application actually exits only through the tray menu's "Exit" command |
| C-04 | P1 | Show hidden files | Settings and session state are inconsistent | The file browser toolbar modifies only the current ViewModel and does not write back to persistent settings | Recommend writing toolbar toggles back to `Transfer.ShowHiddenFiles`; otherwise remove it from the Settings Center and make it explicitly a session state | `AppSettings.cs:276`;`MainWindowViewModel.cs:508`;`FileBrowserViewModel.cs:80,248-260` | ✅ Done: the toolbar toggle writes back and saves `Transfer.ShowHiddenFiles` through the `ShowHiddenFilesToggled` callback; after settings are saved, all open file panels are synchronized through a broadcast; the settings page description documents the linkage between both locations |
| C-05 | P1 | Scrollback line count | Inconsistent default value | The settings model defaults to 50000, while `SettingsViewModel` defaults to 10000 | Keep only one source for the default value; preferably provide it through `AppSettings` or a default configuration factory | `AppSettings.cs:19`;`SettingsViewModel.cs:114` | ✅ Done: the VM initial value now comes from `new AppSettings()` and no longer declares its own business default |
| C-06 | P1 | Default language | Inconsistent default value | The settings model uses `zh-CN`, while the ViewModel uses `en` | Unify the source of the default value | `AppSettings.cs:8`;`SettingsViewModel.cs:90` | ✅ Done: as with C-05, the VM initial value now comes from the settings model |
| C-07 | P1 | Cursor style | Inconsistent default value | The settings model uses `bar`, while the terminal control internally defaults to `block` | Apply the default from the settings model in the terminal control instead of declaring a business default independently | `AppSettings.cs:218`;`VelaTerminalControl.cs:145` | ✅ Done: the control default now matches the model (`bar`), with a comment explaining that the runtime value is supplied by `ApplyLiveTerminalSettings` |
| C-08 | P1 | Settings import/export | Description and scope are inconsistent | The text promises to back up "all connections and settings", but `BuildExportJson()` serializes only `AppSettings` | In the short term, revise the description; in the long term, explicitly support selective export of connections, groups, known hosts, snippets, and other data | `SettingsViewModel.cs:474-482`;`GeneralSettingsPage.axaml:106-107` | ✅ Done (short term): renamed "Settings import/export"; description changed to "Back up or migrate application settings only; connections, groups, keys, and snippets are not included"; selective export remains a future enhancement |
| C-09 | P1 | Interface language | Incomplete localization | Much of the settings page text is hardcoded in Chinese, so the Settings Center may remain partly Chinese after switching to English | Move settings titles, labels, descriptions, and options to `.resx` | Approximately 148 Chinese text instances in `Views/Settings/*.axaml` | ⏳ Pending: the localization infrastructure is already available (`LocalizeExtension` + `Strings.resx/zh-CN.resx`), but migrating and translating approximately 150 strings is a large focused effort. It should be handled as a separate batch to avoid mixing it with this structural remediation |
| C-10 | P1 | Shortcut reference | Display may not match actual bindings | The page uses a separately maintained hardcoded table, and "New connection Ctrl+N" appears twice | Generate the page from the actual shortcut registry; until then, rename it to "Shortcut reference" | `SettingsViewModel.cs:318-355`, especially `:322,336` | ✅ Finished 2026-10-03 (joesdu/VelaShell#551): the global and tab bindings were consolidated into one factory table, `ShortcutBindings`; the main window generates its KeyBindings from it under the current keymap (nothing is hardcoded in `MainWindow.axaml` any more, and a test enforces that), and the shortcuts page and the command palette hints read from it too. The remaining fixed shortcuts are still listed one by one in `ShortcutCatalog`, also test-guarded. Before that: the page was renamed "Shortcut reference"; entries were rebuilt and checked one by one against the actual bindings (`MainWindow KeyBindings`, `KeyboardShortcutService`, `TerminalTabView`, `RemoteFileEditorView`), all fabricated and duplicate entries were removed, and the actual `Ctrl+N` binding, which had been labeled but missing from the menu/command palette, was added. |
| C-11 | P1 | Restore defaults | Destructive operation lacks confirmation | Clicking it immediately resets settings for every page | Add a confirmation dialog and consider adding "Restore defaults for current page" | `SettingsView.axaml:246`;`SettingsViewModel.cs:562-567` | ✅ Done: both Restore defaults and "Clear history" now show a dangerous-action confirmation dialog; "Restore defaults for current page" is an optional enhancement and has not been implemented |

## 3. Settings That Can Be Merged

| ID | Priority | Current settings | Merge conclusion | Recommended merged name | Data migration recommendation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M-01 | P0 | `TerminalBehavior.BellMode` + `TerminalBehavior.VisualBell` | Must merge | Terminal bell behavior | When `VisualBell=true`, migrate to `BellMode=visual`, then delete the old field | ✅ Done: migration is implemented through `AppSettings.Normalize()`; the `VisualBell` field is retained as a read-only migration slot because deleting the field would silently discard old configuration, and it is no longer consumed at runtime |
| M-02 | P1 | `Transfer.AutoResume` + `Transfer.ResumeEnabled` | ~~Both currently unimplemented~~ Resuming interrupted transfers is implemented (probe → verify starting point → 2MB safety fallback, consuming `ResumeEnabled`) | Resume interrupted transfers | `ResumeEnabled` is the sole switch; retain `AutoResume` as a read-only migration slot and do not consume it at runtime | ✅ Done (2026-07-23): the UI now returns as a single "Resume interrupted transfers" switch (File Transfer > Conflict handling); failed items support retry within the panel, and transfer history persists across restarts |

## 4. Similar Names That Must Not Be Merged

| ID | Current name | Actual scope | Merge? | Recommended name | Recommended group | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N-01 | Sound alert | SSH connection disconnected | No | Play a sound when the connection is disconnected | Notifications | ✅ Renamed (General > Behavior; description distinguishes it from the security alert sound) |
| N-02 | Security > Alert sound | Host fingerprints and other security events | No | Play a sound for security events | Security and Privacy > Security Alerts | ✅ Renamed (description distinguishes it from the connection-disconnected alert sound) |
| N-03 | Terminal Bell | Remote program sends the BEL control character | No | Terminal bell behavior | Terminal > Bell and Tab Alerts | ✅ Renamed and placed in the "Bell and Tab Alerts" group |
| N-04 | Alert when disconnected | SSH connection state | No | Show a notification when the connection is disconnected | Notifications | ✅ Renamed |
| N-05 | Show notification after transfer completes | File transfer completion | No | Show a notification when file transfer completes | File Transfer > Transfer Behavior | ✅ Renamed (description distinguishes it from the connection-disconnected notification) |
| N-06 | Maximum retries | SSH automatic reconnect | No | Maximum automatic reconnect attempts | Connection > Automatic Reconnect | ✅ Renamed and moved to the subordinate automatic reconnect position (see C-02) |
| N-07 | Maximum retry attempts | Retries after file transfer failure | No | Transfer failure retry attempts | File Transfer > Advanced; show after implementation | ✅ Hidden in the UI with R-09; return under the recommended name after implementation |
| N-08 | Log retention days | Terminal session logs | No | Terminal session log retention days | General > Data and Logs | ✅ Renamed (description distinguishes it from transfer logs) |
| N-09 | Log retention days | File transfer logs | No | File transfer log retention days | File Transfer > Transfer Logs | ✅ Renamed (description distinguishes it from session logs) |

## 5. Items Recommended for Removal or Temporary Hiding

| ID | Priority | Item | Current state | Recommendation | Condition for showing again | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-01 | P1 | Check for updates at startup | Disabled, unimplemented | Hide from ordinary settings | Update service and update source integration are complete | ✅ **Restored (2026-08-30)** — the condition is met: the message center uses it to decide whether to check for a new version at startup, and posts a message that opens the About page when one is found (see [message-center-and-feed.md](message-center-and-feed.md)). The switch previously had no consumer anywhere in the repository |
| R-02 | P1 | Update channel | Disabled, unimplemented | Hide | Stable and preview update sources are supported | ✅ Hidden (the entire "Updates" group was removed; the About page's "Check for updates" was also changed to honestly say "The update service is not yet connected" instead of pretending that the application is up to date) |
| R-03 | P1 | Download updates automatically | Disabled, unimplemented | Hide | Automatic download and installation flow is complete | ✅ Hidden |
| R-04 | P1 | Master password protection | Disabled, unimplemented | Hide | Key derivation, unlocking, and credential migration are fully implemented | ✅ Hidden (a comment explains that current credentials are encrypted with a local machine key) |
| R-05 | P2 | Tab bar position | Disabled, Dock fixed at top | Hide | The Dock template truly supports switching between top and bottom | ✅ Hidden |
| R-06 | P1 | Load keys into Agent automatically | ~~Disabled, unimplemented~~ Implemented: after a successful private-key-file or certificate authentication, the key (together with the certificate for certificate authentication) is added to the local ssh-agent (like OpenSSH `AddKeysToAgent`) | Show again | `KeyOptions.AddKeysToAgent` now has a runtime consumer | ✅ Returned to the UI (2026-09-23, "SSH Agent" section of the Key Management page). The field was renamed from `AutoLoadToAgent` to `AddKeysToAgent` and is **off by default**: the old field defaulted to `true` but never had a consumer, so the `true` in existing configurations is not user consent. Since 2026-10-06 certificate authentication adds too ("certificate + private key"); when the OpenSSH agent service is not running it goes through the current user's Pageant (the SSH library's default endpoint, `ssh/spec/07-forwarding.md` §7.2) |
| R-07 | P1 | Resume automatically | Disabled, duplicates interrupted transfer resume | Remove current UI | Return as a single setting after interrupted transfer resume is implemented | ✅ Returned as planned as the single "Resume interrupted transfers" setting (2026-07-23, see M-02) |
| R-08 | P1 | Enable interrupted transfer resume | Disabled, duplicates automatic resume | Remove current UI | Return as a single setting after interrupted transfer resume is implemented | ✅ Returned as planned as the single "Resume interrupted transfers" setting (2026-07-23, see M-02) |
| R-09 | P1 | Maximum transfer retry attempts | Disabled, unimplemented | Hide | The transfer retry pipeline is integrated | ✅ Hidden |
| R-10 | P1 | Clean up temporary files automatically | ~~Unimplemented~~ Implemented: delete partial destination files on failure/cancellation (delete the remote file for uploads and the local file for downloads); takes effect only when interrupted transfer resume is disabled | Clean up partial files | `AutoCleanTempFiles` already has runtime consumers | ✅ Returned to the UI (2026-07-23, shown as a subordinate setting of interrupted transfer resume) |
| R-11 | P1 | Record all production sessions by default | Disabled, unimplemented | Hide | Session recording, storage, and privacy documentation are complete | ✅ Implemented and shown again (2026-07-12): recordings are stored in SonnetDB time-series storage, and the Security Audit page provides a toggle and a "Replay Center" entry (design NceE6); renamed "Record all sessions automatically" |
| R-12 | P1 | Input redaction | Disabled, depends on session recording | Hide | Session recording and redaction mechanisms are complete | ✅ Disabled (no longer needed): recording captures only the terminal output stream, passwords are not echoed in the first place, and independent redaction is unnecessary; the field is retained |
| R-13 | P1 | Standalone visual flash toggle | Conflicts with BellMode | Delete | Do not restore after merging into terminal bell behavior | ✅ Deleted (with C-01/M-01) |
| R-14 | P2 | Duplicate "New connection" in shortcuts | Displayed twice | Delete one entry | Generate the page from actual bindings | ✅ Done (the reference table has been rebuilt without duplicates, see C-10) |

## 6. Settings to Retain and Review Results

The following settings were reviewed against their runtime consumers, are effective, and must not be mistakenly deleted.

| Setting | Current implementation evidence | Conclusion | Recommended optimization |
|---|---|---|---|
| Start automatically at system boot | `App.axaml.cs:77,102`;`StartupRegistration.cs` | Retain | Place under "General > Startup and Window" (✅ Implemented) |
| Minimize to tray | `App.axaml.cs:96,103`;`MainWindow.axaml.cs:297` | Retain | Clarify its relationship with exit confirmation (✅ Implemented, see C-03) |
| Upload/download bandwidth limits | `SftpService.cs:39,76,277-288` | Retain | Hide the speed input fields when the master switch is off (✅ Implemented) |
| Preserve file timestamps | `SftpService.cs:288` | Retain | Place under "File Transfer > Transfer Behavior" (already in that group) |
| Transfer completion notification | `FileBrowserViewModel.cs:1076` | Retain | Name it explicitly as the file transfer completion notification (✅ Implemented) |
| Transfer logs | `FileBrowserViewModel.cs:1293-1295` | Retain | Hide the path and retention days when logging is disabled (✅ Implemented) |
| Session log cleanup | `App.axaml.cs:80` | Retain | Rename to terminal session log retention days (✅ Implemented, and conditionally shown with its parent switch) |
| Transfer log cleanup | `App.axaml.cs:81-82` | Retain | Rename to file transfer log retention days (✅ Implemented) |
| Confirm fingerprint on first connection | `InfrastructureServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:199` | Retain | Put it in the same group as the fingerprint change policy (same group) |
| Block on fingerprint change | `InfrastructureServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:221` | Retain | Explain blocking and the manual override policy in the text |

## 7. Recommended New Settings

| ID | Priority | Recommended setting | Current hardcoded behavior or gap | Recommended options | Recommended group | Source evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-01 | P0 | Permission for remote OSC 52 clipboard writes | Remote programs can write to the local clipboard; read queries are blocked | Deny / Ask every time / Always allow | Security and Privacy > Clipboard Permissions | `TerminalEmulator.cs:16,412-428` | Pending evaluation |
| A-02 | P1 | Maximum automatic reconnect attempts | The UI setting does not uniformly control the hardcoded `TerminalTab` limit | 1 to 20 attempts | Connection > Automatic Reconnect | `TerminalTabViewModel.cs:297` | ✅ Done (with C-02: hardcoded limit removed, UI range 1 to 20) |
| A-03 | P1 | Enable remote resource monitoring | CPU, memory, and network metrics are polled at a fixed interval | On/Off | Advanced > Monitoring and Diagnostics | `MainWindowViewModel.cs:708` | Pending evaluation |
| A-04 | P1 | Resource monitoring refresh interval | Currently polled approximately every 1 second | 1 / 2 / 5 / 10 seconds | Advanced > Monitoring and Diagnostics | `MainWindowViewModel.cs:708` | Pending evaluation |
| A-05 | P1 | Enable network latency probing | Currently probed approximately every 3 seconds | On/Off | Advanced > Monitoring and Diagnostics | `MainWindowViewModel.cs:725` | Pending evaluation |
| A-06 | P2 | Semantic highlighting | URLs, IP addresses, and error words are always highlighted on the client | On/Off | Terminal > Display > Advanced | `VelaTerminalControl.cs:126` | Pending evaluation |
| A-07 | P2 | Cursor blink accessibility settings | There is only a toggle, with no rate or reduced-motion strategy | Follow system / Standard / Slow / No blinking | Terminal > Cursor | `VelaTerminalControl.cs` cursor timer | Pending evaluation |
| A-08 | P2 | Editable shortcuts | There is currently only a static reference table | Edit, conflict detection, restore individual default | Shortcuts | `SettingsViewModel.cs:318-355` | ✅ Done 2026-10-03 (joesdu/VelaShell#551, reversing the 07-12 "not planned"): the global and tab bindings can be changed, unbound, and reset one by one or all at once; a clash asks before replacing; bindings that take a key away from the terminal are flagged on the spot. See the tenth batch |

### 7.1 Internal Parameters Not Recommended as Ordinary User Settings

| Parameter | Reason |
|---|---|
| SSH stream read buffer | An internal throughput and latency tuning parameter; users cannot easily determine the correct value |
| ShellStream internal buffer | Should be tuned by the implementation according to the connection and platform |
| Bridge dispose wait time | An implementation detail of the lifecycle |
| Echo suppression count and time window | An implementation detail of protocol bridging |
| Network activity arrow byte threshold | A visual implementation detail with insufficient user value at present |

## 8. Boundary Between Functional Management Tools and Settings

| Current page | Assessment | Recommended destination | Content retained in Settings Center |
|---|---|---|---|
| Key Management | Generating, importing, deleting, and copying keys are credential management tools | A standalone "Credentials and Keys" entry; provide a link from the connection editor | Preferences such as default authentication key |
| Snippets | Snippets are user data and a productivity tool, not a preference | Main navigation, command palette, or terminal context menu | If snippet behavior preferences exist in the future, retain only those preferences |
| Shortcuts | This belongs in settings | Retain in the Settings Center | Renamed back to "Shortcuts": the global and tab bindings are customizable (A-08), and the page is generated from the factory table plus the current changes (C-10) |
| About | An information page, not a setting | It can remain the final entry or be placed at the bottom of settings | Version, license, diagnostic information, and update entry ("Check for updates" now honestly says it is not connected) |

## 9. Recommended Information Architecture

> Status: Not yet implemented as a whole (Phase 4). Local changes implemented in this batch: the General page was rearranged into "Startup and Window / Language / Connection Defaults / Data and Storage / Behavior", automatic reconnect settings were grouped, and the Terminal page gained a "Bell and Tab Alerts" group.

### 9.1 Top-Level Navigation

1. General
2. Appearance
3. Terminal
4. Connection
5. File Transfer
6. Security and Privacy
7. Shortcuts
8. Advanced
9. About

Key Management and Snippets are moved out of the Settings Center and become standalone functional entries.

### 9.2 Detailed Grouping Table

| Top-level group | Second-level group | Settings | Display rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| General | Startup and Window | Start automatically at system boot, restore last session, startup window state, minimize to tray when closing the window, confirm before exiting the application | The "Exit confirmation" description should explain tray behavior |
| General | Language | Interface language (`Language`, empty by default = follow the system: English when the system language is not one of the five UI languages; a language chosen in Settings takes precedence) | The settings page must be localized in sync; the first dropdown item is "Follow system" |
| General | Behavior | Follow the active terminal tab (`General.FollowActiveTerminalInExplorer`), collapse groups on startup (`General.CollapseGroupsByDefault`, off by default) | The collapse option only decides the initial state **the first time a group is seen in this run**; manual expand/collapse is remembered in-process and a full tree rebuild does not fold it back |
| General | Data Management | Import settings, export settings, clear recent connections, restore defaults | Restore defaults must require confirmation; export scope must be accurate |
| General | Application Updates | Check for updates at startup, update channel, download automatically | Hide the whole group until the feature is implemented |
| Appearance | Application Theme | Theme mode, theme color (`AccentColor`, factory empty = follow theme), interface font, interface font size | Keep real-time preview; "Follow theme" sits in front of the swatches; any other color comes from the color picker (interaction-and-ui-specs §14.3) |
| Appearance | Window and Layout | Window opacity, show menu bar, sidebar position, show tabs in multiple rows (`Appearance.MultiRowTabs`, off by default), splash screen (`Appearance.SplashStyle`, Classic out of the box; Windows only) | Hide tab bar position until implemented; multiple rows is the same value as the check item of the same name in the tab right-click menu; the splash screen dropdown has a live preview under it and takes effect on the next launch (thirteenth batch) |
| Terminal | Font and Display | Terminal font, font size, line height, scrollback buffer, semantic highlighting | Semantic highlighting can be placed in an advanced collapsed section |
| Terminal | Colors | Color scheme, foreground color, background color, cursor color, selection color, ANSI palette | Collapse the ANSI palette by default; if it cannot be edited, label it as a preview |
| Terminal | Cursor | Cursor style, blink, blink accessibility settings | Support reduced motion |
| Terminal | Terminal Protocol | TERM type, output encoding | Explain that TERM affects new connections only |
| Terminal | Bell and Tab Alerts | Terminal bell behavior, background-tab Bell alerts | Delete the standalone visual flash toggle |
| Terminal | Scrolling | Auto-scroll while output is being received, scroll to bottom on keypress | Retain as independent settings |
| Terminal | Clipboard and Selection | Copy on select, paste on right click, trim trailing spaces, select word on double-click, copy with Ctrl+C, confirm multiline paste | Order by input/output risk |
| Terminal | Input and Session | IME, execute command after connection | A risk warning for startup commands would be more appropriate |
| Connection | Connection Defaults | Default port, connection timeout, heartbeat interval | Move from General |
| Connection | Automatic Reconnect | Automatic reconnect, maximum attempts, reconnect interval | Hide subordinate settings when automatic reconnect is disabled |
| Connection | Authentication Preferences | Remember password, default authentication key | Provide a link to Key Management |
| File Transfer | Paths and Editor | Local download directory, default editor | Retain |
| File Transfer | Transfer Behavior | Maximum concurrency, preserve timestamps (an SFTP upload sets the modification time on the same handle before closing, one round trip), flush uploads to disk (`Transfer.FsyncAfterUpload`, off by default: `fsync@openssh.com` before an SFTP upload is closed, skipped on servers without it, and a failed flush fails the upload), conflict handling, show hidden files, completion notification, delete remote folders with rm -rf (`Transfer.UseRecursiveDeleteCommand`, on by default) | The hidden-file state must be unified; the `rm -rf` entry must state three things: it applies **only to SSH sessions that have an exec channel** (standalone SFTP / FTP / plugin protocols always walk the tree over SFTP), it **falls back to the SFTP walk automatically** when the command is unavailable or exits non-zero, and **there is no per-entry progress** on that path (the bar goes indeterminate, and cancelling can only close the channel). The delete confirmation prompt is unchanged |
| File Transfer | Bandwidth Limits | Master switch, upload limit, download limit | Hide both rate fields when disabled |
| File Transfer | Transfer Logs | Record logs, retention days, storage path | Hide subordinate settings when logging is disabled |
| File Transfer | Resume and Retry | Interrupted transfer resume, transfer retries, clean up temporary files | Show only after all are implemented |
| Security and Privacy | Host Identity Verification | Confirm fingerprint on first connection, block on fingerprint change | Explain first trust and change policies together |
| Security and Privacy | Clipboard Permissions | OSC 52 write permission | Recommend Deny or Ask every time by default |
| Security and Privacy | Credentials | Remember password, master password protection | If "Remember password" is placed on the connection page, provide only a link here and do not duplicate the control |
| Security and Privacy | Security Alerts | In-app notifications, security alert sound, Webhook, Webhook URL | Show the URL only after Webhook is enabled |
| Security and Privacy | Session Audit | Session recording (✅ Implemented: toggle + Replay Center entry), audit log (✅ Implemented: viewer window + retention days `Security.AuditLogRetentionDays`), input redaction (not planned, output-stream recording does not echo passwords) | Shown |
| Shortcuts | Shortcuts | Show actual bindings by command | The global and tab bindings can be changed, unbound and reset (A-08); everything else is a fixed, read-only shortcut |
| Advanced | Monitoring and Diagnostics | Resource monitoring, refresh interval, latency probing | Collapse by default or label the additional network overhead |
| About | Application Information | Version, runtime environment, license, configuration directory, update entry | Exclude from Restore defaults |

## 10. Conditional Display Rules

> Implementation prerequisite (landed on 2026-07-11): `GeneralOptions/TransferOptions/SecurityOptions/TerminalBehaviorOptions/KeyOptions` all inherit from `ObservableOptions` (INPC). Otherwise, `IsVisible` bindings for subordinate items would not refresh when the parent switch changes. The conditional display of the Webhook URL had failed for exactly this reason.

| Parent setting | Subordinate settings | Recommended behavior | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Automatic reconnect | Maximum automatic reconnect attempts, reconnect interval | Hide or disable when the parent is off, while retaining saved values | ✅ Implemented (hidden, value retained) |
| Enable bandwidth limits | Upload speed limit, download speed limit | Hide when the parent is off | ✅ Implemented |
| Record transfer logs | Retention days, log path | Hide when the parent is off | ✅ Implemented |
| Webhook | Webhook URL | Conditional display already exists; retain it | ✅ Fixed (actually works after INPC) |
| Terminal color scheme | Custom colors, ANSI palette | Collapse advanced editing when using a preset; expand after entering custom mode | ⏳ Pending (to be done with the Phase 4 Appearance/Terminal page restructuring) |
| Session logs | Terminal session log retention days | Hide when the parent is off | ✅ Implemented |

## 11. Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Fix Behavioral Correctness (✅ Completed 2026-07-11)

- [x] Merge BellMode and VisualBell
- [x] Unify automatic reconnect attempts
- [x] Unify the source of settings default values
- [x] Persist the Show hidden files state

### Phase 2: Fix Misleading Text and Pages (Completed except for localization)

- [x] Correct the import/export scope description
- [x] Migrate localization text on settings pages (C-09, recommended as a separate batch)
- [x] Generate the shortcuts page from actual runtime bindings (manual verification and rebuilding completed, including the `Ctrl+N` binding; automatic generation remains pending until binding registration points are consolidated); since 2026-10-03 the global and tab bindings are consolidated into the factory table and generated from it, see C-10
- [x] Delete duplicate shortcut entries
- [x] Rename settings related to sounds, notifications, retries, and logs

### Phase 3: Clean Up Unimplemented Features (✅ Completed 2026-07-11)

- [x] Hide unimplemented update settings
- [x] Hide master password and ssh-agent settings
- [x] Delete duplicate resume-transfer UI
- [x] Hide unimplemented transfer retry and cleanup settings
- [x] Hide unimplemented session recording and redaction settings (later, on 2026-07-12: recording was implemented and shown again, see R-11)
- [x] Hide unsupported tab bar position

### Phase 4: Adjust the Information Architecture

- [x] Move connection defaults from General to Connection
- [x] Move terminal colors from Appearance to Terminal
- [x] Move startup window state to General
- [ ] Move Key Management out of the Settings Center

### Phase 5: Add High-Value Settings

- [x] Add OSC 52 clipboard permissions
- [x] Add resource monitoring and latency probing controls
- [x] Add a semantic highlighting toggle
- [x] Add cursor blink accessibility settings
- [x] Evaluate editable shortcuts (concluded "do not implement" on 2026-07-12; reversed and implemented on 2026-10-03 because of joesdu/VelaShell#551, see A-08)

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Every persistent setting has one clear data source and one source for its default value
- [x] No two settings control the same final behavior with opaque priority
- [x] Every visible setting produces the actual effect described by its text (including changing "Check for updates" to an honest status message)
- [x] Unimplemented features no longer pretend to be configurable items
- [x] The settings UI can switch completely with the interface language (pending C-09)
- [x] The shortcuts page matches runtime bindings (currently manually checked; this item can be maintenance-free only after automatic generation); the global and tab bindings are generated from the factory table since 2026-10-03
- [x] All destructive operations have confirmation mechanisms (Restore defaults, Clear history)
- [x] Subordinate settings are shown only when the parent feature is enabled (except terminal color scheme collapsing, to be handled in Phase 4)
- [x] User data management such as keys and snippets is no longer mixed with preference settings (Phase 4)
- [x] Capabilities crossing the remote/local trust boundary, such as OSC 52, have explicit permission controls (A-01 pending evaluation)

## 14. Remediation Record

### 2026-07-11 First batch (Phases 1 to 3 + Conditional Display)

**Behavior fixes**

- `AppSettings.Normalize()`: when loading (through both settings services) and importing JSON, migrates `VisualBell=true` to `BellMode=visual` and clears the old value; `VelaTerminalControl` removes the `VisualBell` property, and Bell now follows only the three `BellMode` states.
- `TerminalTabViewModel.MaxReconnectAttempts` changed from a hardcoded 3 to a value supplied by the host in `OnTabDisconnected` according to `General.MaxRetries`.
- The file browser toolbar's "Show hidden files" toggle now goes through the `ShowHiddenFilesToggled` callback to `MainWindowViewModel.PersistShowHiddenFiles`, which writes back and saves it; after settings are saved, all cached panels are synchronized through a broadcast.
- The initial values of `Language/ScrollbackLines` in `SettingsViewModel` now come from `new AppSettings()`; the default value of `VelaTerminalControl.CursorStyle` is aligned with the model.
- Dangerous confirmation dialogs were added for Restore defaults and Clear history (in view code-behind).
- The option classes (`General/TerminalBehavior/Transfer/Security/Keys`) now uniformly inherit from `ObservableOptions` (INPC), supporting real-time conditional visibility and fixing the Webhook URL conditional display issue.

**Text and pages**

- General page rearranged: the update group and master password are hidden; reconnect settings are grouped under "Behavior" and shown conditionally; import/export, logging, notifications, sounds, and other items were renamed according to §4.
- Terminal page: added the "Bell and Tab Alerts" group, with the three-state "Terminal bell behavior", and removed "Visual flash".
- Transfer page: removed the three unimplemented UI items for resume, retry, and cleanup; bandwidth and transfer log subordinate items are shown conditionally; log retention days was renamed.
- Security Audit page: session recording and input redaction are hidden, and the alert sound was renamed.
- Appearance page: tab bar position hidden. Key page: Agent toggle hidden.
- Shortcuts page renamed "Shortcut reference" and rebuilt from actual bindings; `MainWindow.axaml` gained the actual `Ctrl+N` binding; the About page's "Check for updates" was changed to an honest status message.

**Verification**: `dotnet build` passed for the full solution; 601 tests passed. The only failure, `ConPty_SpawnsShell_HandshakesAndSignalsEof`, also fails on the unchanged working tree (environment-related and unrelated to this batch).

### 2026-07-12 Second batch (Three-Way Host Fingerprint Confirmation + Trusted Host Management)

Background: after the user enabled "Require manual fingerprint confirmation on first connection", no dialog appeared. The cause was not a missing link in the chain. The target host had already been automatically recorded by TOFU before the switch was enabled (persisted in the SonnetDB `known_hosts` collection, no longer in `~/.velashell/known_hosts.json`; that file is used only as a one-time import source on first run), and there was no UI for deleting trusted records.

- **Confirmation dialog changed to three choices** (consistent with mainstream SSH clients): permanently trust (write to known_hosts) / trust for this session only (in-process `HostTrustOnceCache`, not persisted, ask again after restart) / cancel (reject and abort the connection, fail-closed). `IHostKeyPrompt.ConfirmAsync(bool)` was refactored to `DecideAsync(HostKeyDecision)`; fingerprint changes (when the blocking switch is off) use the same three choices.
- **Added "Trusted Hosts" management** (Settings → Security Audit): list host:port, key type, and SHA256 fingerprint, with per-item deletion; deletion takes effect immediately, and the first-connection confirmation flow runs again on the next connection.
- **Fixed the gap where SFTP channels did not validate host fingerprints**: the standalone SFTP channel previously did not subscribe to `HostKeyReceived` (= trusted any fingerprint by default, creating MITM risk); it now strictly compares against known_hosts or temporary trust from the current run, rejecting mismatches without showing a dialog.
- The security alerts gained the `hostkey-trusted-once` event type.
- **Trusted host addresses are masked by default** (to prevent screenshot leaks): added a "Hide host addresses" switch, enabled by default (shows a fixed-length mask and does not reveal the address length); only manually disabling it shows the IP and port. This switch is intentionally not persistent and returns to hidden every time the settings are opened. Fingerprints remain visible to distinguish entries (public key hashes, not sensitive information).

**Verification**: full build passed; 268 `VelaShell.Tests` tests and 148 `Core.Tests` tests passed (including new three-choice dialog cases).

### 2026-07-12 Third batch (Session Recording and Replay + Webhook Repair + Cloud Sync)

- **Session recording and replay (design NceE6, R-11 implemented)**:
  - Storage: metadata is stored in the SonnetDB document collection `recordings`; output chunks are stored in the time-series measurement `session_recording_chunks` (tag: recording_id; fields: offset_ms/data-Base64; time = start time + offset);
  - Capture: uses the same hook point as session logs (`SshTerminalBridge.DataReceived`), buffers into 600ms/64KB chunks and writes them in the background; failures disable recording automatically without affecting the session; the `Security.RecordProductionSessions` switch applies to connections established afterward; retention days are cleaned at startup together with "Terminal session log retention days";
  - Replay Center (standalone window): recording list (name/time/duration/size), read-only terminal replay on a timeline, drag-to-seek (instant replay after reset), 1x/2x/4x speed, skip idle segments (retains a one-second pause feel), delete, export to asciicast v2 (`.cast`, asciinema-compatible), and an automatic recording toggle;
  - R-12 input redaction confirmed as not planned: recording captures only the output stream, and passwords are not echoed.
- **Webhook**: the complete feature path was confirmed (security event JSON POST + 5-second timeout + silent failure), so it was retained; the URL input area was changed to a subordinate block with a "Webhook URL" label and payload format description, shown after the switch is enabled.
- **Cloud Sync (new feature, user-requested)**: GitHub Gist multi-device synchronization (settings, connections including tunnels, and snippets), with native Gist revisions as version history, optional PBKDF2+AES-GCM end-to-end encryption, as described on Settings → Cloud Sync; sync configuration and tokens are stored only locally.
- Other changes: added a "Support and Donations" page to Settings; confirmed that the Shortcuts page is display-only (A-08 closed); trusted host addresses are masked by default.

### 2026-09-20 Fourth batch (#474: collapse groups on startup + delete remote folders with rm -rf)

Two new settings, both part of user request #474 (host side: `plan.md` §82).

- **`General.CollapseGroupsByDefault` (General, off by default)**: the explorer loads its groups collapsed.
  It only decides the initial state **the first time a group is seen in this run** — whatever the user expands or
  collapses by hand is remembered in-process, so the full tree rebuilds triggered by creating / editing / deleting a
  connection or by a cloud-sync write-back do not fold it back. The memory is not persisted; a restart returns to what
  the setting says.
  ⚠️ On its own this option is of limited use: it is only complete together with pinned connections (frequently used
  connections are hoisted to the very top of the tree and stay visible while everything is collapsed). See
  [interaction-and-ui-specs.md](interaction-and-ui-specs.md) §4.
- **`Transfer.UseRecursiveDeleteCommand` (File Transfer > Transfer Behavior, on by default)**: deleting a remote folder
  first tries a single `rm -rf` instead of walking the tree entry by entry over SFTP.
  - **Why it defaults to on**: the SFTP path first lists the whole tree to compute a total (for the progress bar) and
    then sends one `SSH_FXP_REMOVE`/`RMDIR` per entry, so round trips scale with the file count; `rm -rf` is one round
    trip. The result is identical.
  - **Scope**: it applies only to **SSH sessions that have an exec channel**. Standalone SFTP profiles, FTP and plugin
    protocols such as S3 have no command channel and always walk the tree over SFTP. Three more gates: real directories
    only (symbolic links are still deleted as leaves, unchanged semantics), the path must be absolute, and it must not
    be the root directory.
  - **Failure means fallback**: if the command is missing, blocked by policy, or exits non-zero after deleting only part
    of the tree, it falls back to the SFTP walk — and the fallback surfaces the real error rather than a context-free
    `rm: exit 1`.
  - **Known cost (stated in the setting description)**: there is no per-entry progress on this path (the bar goes
    indeterminate), and cancelling can only close the channel — the remote `rm` may already have finished.
    **The delete confirmation prompt is unchanged.**

### 2026-09-20 Fifth batch (#476: fingerprint changes now ask instead of blocking)

The default of `Security.BlockOnFingerprintChange` **flipped from on to off** (host side: `plan.md` §83).

- **Why**: "the machine was replaced, the IP did not change" is the most common legitimate fingerprint
  change there is. The old default (block) reported it as a connection error — and specifically as
  Tmds.Ssh's English `UntrustedPeer`, which neither says the host key changed nor suggests what to do
  next; the only way out was to delete the record from `.velashell` by hand. Other SSH clients raise an
  "accept and overwrite / reject" dialog here, and VelaShell already had that dialog (the three-way
  prompt) — the default value was simply keeping it from ever showing.
- **What it does now**: a changed fingerprint goes through the same three-way prompt as first-connection
  confirmation (trust permanently = overwrite known_hosts / trust once / cancel). The dialog gained two
  things: **the recorded fingerprint from known_hosts** next to the current one (you need both to tell
  your own reinstall apart from an interception), and a line of guidance naming those two possibilities.
- **One-time migration**: the `true` sitting in existing configs cannot be told apart from the old
  default, so this follows the same pattern as session recording and the proxy default — turn it off
  once, stamp `Security.FingerprintChangeDefaultMigrated`, and respect the user from then on. Anyone
  wanting strict fail-closed behaviour turns "Block and alert on fingerprint change" back on and gets
  exactly the old behaviour.
- **Rejections say something useful**: whether the policy blocked it or the user cancelled, the error is
  now localized text naming the host, both fingerprints, and the Settings → Security & Audit → Trusted
  hosts route to remove the record.
- **Jump chains use the same policy**: the jump hop used to run a separate check that silently returned
  false for unknown *and* changed keys — so a machine only ever used as a jump host failed on its first
  use. It now goes through the same `AddHostAuthentication`.
- **The connect timeout during the prompt**: Tmds.Ssh 0.24's `ConnectTimeout` covers the whole handshake,
  **including** the HostAuthentication callback, so the timer keeps running while the dialog is open.
  Think for fifteen seconds and the connection is already timed out by the time you click. The decision
  has taken effect by then, so the wrapper **reconnects once** on this particular failure (once only).

### 2026-09-23 Sixth batch (new “X Server” page)

A new top-level section **X Server** (after “Proxy”) configures the local X server — on Windows, the VcXsrv the user
installed (host side: `plan.md` §100). All new settings live in `AppSettings.XServer` (`XServerOptions`); configs saved
before this section existed get the defaults from `Normalize`.

| Setting | Default | VcXsrv argument | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VcXsrv executable | empty = auto-detect | — | Tries Program Files, Scoop, then PATH; **a filled-in path is the only one used** — if it is missing that is reported as such, never silently swapped for another install |
| Display number | Auto | `:N` | Auto = the first display nobody listens on, starting at :0; a fixed number that is taken fails before launching. Range :0–:15, clamped the same way by `Normalize` |
| Window mode | Multiple windows | `-multiwindow` / (none) / `-nodecoration` / `-fullscreen` / `-rootless` | Unrecognized values fall back to multiple windows. Shared by both engines since 2026-10-10: on the built-in engine one large window / no title bar / fullscreen start it in one-window mode (the whole X desktop in one window, a remote window manager takes over), while multiple windows and rootless both give one window per program; takes effect the next time the X Server starts |
| Enable clipboard | on | `-clipboard` / `-noclipboard` | |
| Copy on selection | on (off by default since 2026-10, see the eleventh batch) | `-primary` / `-noprimary` | Only meaningful with the clipboard on; disabled and omitted from the command line otherwise |
| Keyboard layout | Auto | `-xkblayout` | Shared by both engines. Auto = not passed to VcXsrv (it follows the Windows layout), and the built-in engine follows the system's current layout; a chosen layout is passed to VcXsrv as `-xkblayout` and the built-in engine uses the keymap tables shipped with the app |
| Keyboard model | pc105 | `-xkbmodel` | |
| Capture special Windows keys | off | `-keyhook` / `-nokeyhook` | |
| Native OpenGL (WGL) | on | `-wgl` / `-nowgl` | |
| Disable access control | off | `-ac` | The description states the risk; connections arriving through SSH X11 forwarding come from 127.0.0.1 and do not need it |
| Additional VcXsrv arguments | empty | appended verbatim, last | For the same switch the later one wins; the “Help” button next to it documents every VcXsrv argument in five languages |
| Start when VelaShell starts | off | — | |
| Start automatically for X11 forwarding | on | — | Stays out of the way silently when another X server already listens on :0 or VcXsrv is not installed |
| Show tray icon | off | `-trayicon` / `-notrayicon` | VcXsrv's own tray icon |

- **Every switch is written out in both states** rather than relying on VcXsrv's defaults (which have changed between
  versions); the page previews the exact command line for the next start.
- Changes **apply the next time the X server starts** (the subtitle says so); a running X server that is showing windows
  is never restarted behind the user's back.
- On non-Windows platforms the page is a single note: Linux uses the desktop's own X / XWayland, macOS uses XQuartz,
  both through `DISPLAY`.

### 2026-09-24 Seventh batch (X Server page: built-in engine)

The “X Server” page gains an **Engine** section at the top. The default is now the host's built-in X server
(`VelaShell.XServer`, ships with the app; host side in `plan.md` §105); VcXsrv becomes an option on Windows. The new setting
lives in `AppSettings.XServer.Engine`; unrecognized values fall back to built-in in `Normalize`.

| Setting | Default | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engine | Built-in | `builtin` / `vcxsrv` | Only shown on Windows; other platforms only have the built-in one, and a `vcxsrv` value (e.g. synced from Windows) is treated as built-in |

- **Shared by both engines**: display number, window mode (since 2026-10-10), enable clipboard, copy on selection, keyboard layout, start with VelaShell, start automatically
  for X11 forwarding. On the built-in engine the two clipboard switches map to the server's CLIPBOARD / PRIMARY sync (since 2026-10
  the built-in engine also exchanges only with the session that has the keyboard focus, see the eleventh batch).
- **VcXsrv-only**, shown only when VcXsrv is selected: program location, keyboard model, capture special
  keys, native OpenGL, disable access control, additional arguments and the command-line preview, tray icon. On Windows the
  built-in engine follows the system keyboard layout and needs no configuration.
- The “stay out of it” condition of “Start automatically for X11 forwarding” becomes: another X server is already in use —
  on Windows something listens on `localhost:0` (since 2026-10 only a process in the current user's session counts, see the eleventh
  batch), elsewhere `DISPLAY` is set; a selected-but-missing VcXsrv is silent too.
- The former “on non-Windows platforms the page is a single note” is gone: the built-in engine works everywhere, so the page is
  shown on every platform (except the Engine section).

### 2026-09-27 Eighth batch (#521: show tabs in multiple rows)

Appearance → Window gains a switch matching Visual Studio's "Show tabs in multiple rows". Host side in `plan.md` §127,
interaction in [interaction-and-ui-specs.md](interaction-and-ui-specs.md) §4B.3.

| Setting | Default | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Show Tabs in Multiple Rows | Off | On / off (`Appearance.MultiRowTabs`) | Off: when one row is too narrow, the widest tabs shrink first (120px floor), then the strip scrolls; on: tabs wrap onto more rows and the strip grows |

- **Two entry points, one value**: any tab's right-click menu has a check item of the same name, and toggling it writes this
  setting back; saving the settings page flows back into the tab strip the same way. Nothing is saved again when the value
  flowing back is unchanged, so the two sides never bounce writes off each other.
- One switch for the whole workspace, so every pane changes together; it only applies to tab strips at the top, and the menu
  item is disabled when the strip is docked left or right.
- The row label and the menu item use the same localization key (`Dock_MultiRowTabs`), so the two always say the same thing.

### 2026-09-29 Ninth batch (accent follows the theme + audit log viewing and retention)

Host side in `plan.md` §131 / §135, interaction in [interaction-and-ui-specs.md](interaction-and-ui-specs.md) §14 and §15.

| Setting | Default | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Theme color | Empty (follow theme) | Empty / `#RRGGBB` (`AccentColor`) | The factory value used to be `#E91E63`, and an accent override outranks the theme — so every one of the twelve themes had its own accent covered by the same pink. An empty string means no override: the current theme's own accent is used |
| Audit log retention days | 180 | 1–3650 (`Security.AuditLogRetentionDays`) | Shared by the audit log and the connection history (`conn_history`); older entries are pruned at startup |

- **Saved theme colors are not migrated**: a stored `#E91E63` cannot tell a user's choice from the old factory value, so it
  stays in effect. A "Follow theme" button now sits in front of the swatches, and the input's placeholder says "Follow
  theme" too — before, the only way back to the theme's accent was to clear the input.
- **Audit log retention also governs connection history**: connection history is the ledger behind "Recent connections";
  keeping it longer than the audit makes no sense, and keeping it shorter would leave sessions in the audit that the
  sidebar no longer knows. The clamp lives in `Normalize`, and the settings page's `NumericUpDown` uses the same range.
  Pruning happens **at startup only**, at the same time as session logs and recordings expire, as a time-based `DELETE`
  rather than the recordings' "stage → rebuild → restore".
- "View" in the same section opens the audit log window (read-only, not a setting).

### 2026-10-03 Tenth batch (joesdu/VelaShell#551: customizable shortcuts)

Host side in `plan.md` §155; the rules are under "Customizing shortcuts" in [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md).

| Setting | Default | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Custom shortcuts | Empty (every binding at its factory default) | Binding id → gesture (`Shortcuts.Overrides`); empty string = unbound | Only the changed entries are stored; an unrecognized gesture falls back to the factory default |

- **Reverses A-08's "not planned"**: #551 reported nano's `^K` (cut line) being swallowed by the command palette.
  Window-level bindings consume keys before the terminal control sees them, so any set of factory bindings collides with
  some remote program (bash's `^W`, tmux's `^B`, vim's `^F`…); letting users unbind them is the only answer that holds.
- **What can be changed**: the "Global" and "Tabs & Panels" groups (except pane focus `Alt+arrows`, which is only
  intercepted while split anyway), plus search, clear screen and the three zoom bindings in the "Terminal" group. Everything
  else (copy/paste, scrolling, the completion popup, each dialog's Esc / Enter, mouse gestures) stays fixed.
- **Rules for a new binding**: it needs Ctrl or Alt (or Win / Cmd); without a modifier only F1–F24 are allowed; fixed
  shortcuts cannot be taken; if another action already has the gesture you are asked first, and replacing it leaves that
  one unbound; recording the factory default again counts as no change and leaves no entry.
- **Staged until saved**: like every other setting, changes are written when you click "Save settings"; the main window
  then rebuilds its KeyBindings and the command palette hints follow. Settings export / import carries it, and cloud sync
  includes it when app settings are synced (it is not a device-local field).
- The page title went back from "Shortcut reference" to "Shortcuts", and the subtitle no longer says "read-only" (those
  words are what put off the reporter of #551).

### 2026-10-07 Eleventh batch (X Server: clipboard follows the focus, restricting programs from SSH sessions)

Changed together with the X Server's second library-wide review. Library behaviour: [X Server architecture](../xserver/design/architecture.md)
§7, "Several sessions sharing one display — what is tightened", and §10; interaction: [interaction-and-ui-specs.md](interaction-and-ui-specs.md)
§4A.3 and §13.1; what users see and what to do: [X Server troubleshooting](../xserver/troubleshooting.md).

| Setting | Default | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Copy on selection | **off** (was on) | on / off (`XServer.CopyOnSelection`) | Shared by both engines; VcXsrv's default command line therefore has `-noprimary`. On the built-in engine it maps to the server's PRIMARY sync (`SyncPrimary`) — the host used to default it to on, the opposite of the library's own default |
| Restrict programs from SSH sessions | off | on / off (`XServer.RestrictForwardedClients`) | Built-in engine only, and only shown when it is selected (below the keyboard layout in the “Keyboard” section). Maps to the library's `RestrictForwardedClients`: programs forwarded over SSH cannot see XTEST, receive no raw key events and cannot change input devices |

- **Why “Copy on selection” is now off by default**: when on, whatever is copied locally (passwords included) can be pasted into any X program
  with a middle click, and selecting text in an X program quietly rewrites the system clipboard. **Only the factory default changed; saved
  configs are not migrated**: a saved “on” cannot be told apart from the old default, so it stays in effect until the user turns it off.
- **The clipboard following the session with the keyboard focus is not a setting**: it is always in effect on the built-in engine (the library's
  `ClipboardFollowsFocus` is on by default and the host leaves it so) — only the focused session can read what is copied locally, and only copies
  from that session reach the system clipboard; `xclip` / `xsel` in the same SSH session count as the same session. The sessions'
  selections (PRIMARY / SECONDARY / CLIPBOARD) are isolated from each other; copying across sessions goes through the local clipboard. The description of
  “Enable clipboard” says so.
- **The descriptions state the risks** (five languages): “Copy on selection” adds “Off by default: when on, whatever you copy on this computer can
  be pasted into X programs with a middle click”; “Restrict programs from SSH sessions” names the three restrictions and the cost — recommended
  when connecting to servers you do not fully trust, after which tools such as `xdotool` on those servers stop working.
- **Why the restriction is off by default and built-in only**: remote tools such as `xdotool` rely on XTEST, so the default keeps today's
  behaviour (a product decision); telling which connections came “from SSH” is only possible with the built-in engine (the host hands those
  connections in through `ServeAuthenticatedAsync`), VcXsrv cannot tell them apart. A per-connection trust level and “one display per session”
  are new features for later.
- **The “stay out of it” condition of “Start automatically for X11 forwarding” is narrower**: on Windows a listener behind `localhost:0` counts as
  “an X display already in use” only if it is a process in the current user's session — on a terminal server it may be another user's VcXsrv
  (often with `-ac`), and remote programs' windows, keyboard and clipboard used to end up on someone else's desktop; if it is not ours, the
  built-in engine starts automatically as usual (`:0` is taken, so the next free display number is picked). With a display address written into
  the config, or auto-start turned off, forwarding still follows `DISPLAY` / `localhost:0`.
- **Display number “Auto”**: when a number the probe found free turns out to be taken at start (someone got in between the probe and the bind, or
  a lock file / abstract name shows a use the probe cannot see), the next free number is tried, up to 4 times, with the state staying “Starting”
  meanwhile; a number set by hand still reports the error directly.
- **“Trusted (`-Y`)” on the connection** (not an X Server page setting, recorded here as well): the hint now explains that all forwarded sessions
  share one display — they can see each other's windows, read the clipboard and send input; the built-in X Server and most X servers on Windows
  support only trusted forwarding, and untrusted mode needs an external X server with the SECURITY extension plus a local `xauth`. When the
  display comes from the built-in X Server and the connection asks for untrusted mode, forwarding is not set up and a yellow line at the top of
  the terminal explains why, with two ways out (tick Trusted, or use an external X server). Since 2026-10-10 the built-in X Server supports
  both (an untrusted channel connects as an untrusted client) and that yellow line is gone; the hint is rewritten again to explain what each
  mode means — with an external X server untrusted mode still needs the SECURITY extension and a local `xauth`, and a few old programs do not
  work correctly when untrusted.

### 2026-10-10 Twelfth batch (X Server: the draft's new features)

Added with the built-in X server's new features (`xs_plan` F1–F30). Library behaviour: [X Server architecture](../xserver/design/architecture.md) §7
("Trust levels", "One display per SSH session", "One-window mode", "Added on 2026-10-10") and §10; interaction: the X Server part of
[interaction-and-ui-specs.md](interaction-and-ui-specs.md); symptoms and what to do: [X Server troubleshooting](../xserver/troubleshooting.md).
All apply to the built-in engine only (except "Window mode", which both engines share) and take effect the next time the X Server starts (except
"Show where X windows come from", which applies immediately). Where they sit on the settings page: the transparency and source items are in the
"Display" section (below window mode), the input method in "Keyboard", and "Restrict programs from SSH sessions", one display per session and the
TCP port in the new "Security" section (they all used to sit under "Keyboard").

| Setting | Default | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Window mode | Multiple windows | The existing five (`XServer.WindowMode`) | Used to affect VcXsrv only; now shared by both engines: on the built-in engine one large window / no title bar / fullscreen start it in one-window mode (the whole X desktop in one window, a remote window manager takes over), while multiple windows and rootless both give one window per program |
| One display per SSH session | off | on / off (`XServer.DisplayPerSession`) | X programs from different SSH sessions get separate displays: they cannot see each other's windows, read each other's keyboard or clipboard, or inject input; X programs on this computer keep using the shared display; each session costs a little memory and a thread. In one-window mode, closing one session's "X Desktop" window closes only that session's display |
| Use this computer's input method in X windows | **on** | on / off (`XServer.UseHostInputMethod`) | Text composed by the local input method is typed into X programs directly (no fcitx / ibus needed on the server); off sends keys to the remote side as they are, so its own input method works. This reverses the earlier "no XIM" decision: the built-in X Server is also an XIM input method server (`@im=velashell`); programs connected over XIM receive committed runs whole, the candidate window follows their insertion point, and on-the-spot programs draw the preedit themselves; `XMODIFIERS=@im=velashell` is set silently in the shell after connecting (an existing value is kept). The switch only applies to the built-in engine and takes effect after restarting the X Server |
| Show where X windows come from | **on** | on / off (`XServer.ShowWindowSource`) | Titles of windows forwarded over SSH (also the taskbar text) and tray icon tooltips read "user@host:22 — title", with the source first so nothing the remote side puts in the title can hide it; programs connected locally are not labelled. **Applies immediately**: open windows are retitled on the spot (the description used to say "applies to windows opened afterwards", but it actually needed an X Server restart). Windows that draw their own title bar show the source only in the taskbar |
| Transparent X windows | off | on / off (`XServer.CompositingManager`) | The server acts as compositing manager so GTK's rounded corners and shadows and Electron's transparent windows get alpha. Off by default: windows with alpha cost the system an extra compositing layer, not yet measured on real machines; while off, windows with alpha are shown opaque. No effect in the single-window modes |
| Also listen on a TCP port | off | on / off (`XServer.ListenTcpOnUnix`) | Only shown on Linux / macOS: by default only the Unix socket is open; when on, the port listens on 127.0.0.1 only, for programs that connect to this computer's loopback over TCP (containers using host networking); containers on a bridge network cannot reach it — on Linux mount `/tmp/.X11-unix` into them and use `DISPLAY=:N`. On Windows the port is always open (WSL and Cygwin programs only use TCP) and the setting is not shown |

- **Why these defaults**: the input method and source labels are on — without the former CJK users cannot type in remote programs, the latter guards
  against impersonation; the compositing manager is off (cost not measured); the TCP port being off on Linux / macOS is a behaviour change: loopback
  TCP used to be always open, and on those platforms that port was just one more way in for other local processes and users. The maintainer
  confirmed on 2026-10-10 that these defaults stay, with one display per SSH session off.
- **Descriptions follow the platform**: the built-in engine note and the display-number description say `DISPLAY=localhost:N` (TCP) on Windows
  and `DISPLAY=:N` (the Unix socket; TCP off by default) on Linux / macOS — they used to say `localhost:N` everywhere, which Linux users following
  them could not connect to. The display address in the start notification and the button tooltip likewise follows the listeners actually open.

### 2026-10-10 Thirteenth batch (splash screen)

A cold start takes seven or eight seconds before the main window appears, and nothing is on screen in between, so users think the app failed to
open. The splash screen shows as soon as the process is up (Windows, a native window from `Program.Main`) and fades out once the main window has
painted its first frame. Interaction: [interaction-and-ui-specs.md](interaction-and-ui-specs.md) §14.5.

| Setting | Default | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splash screen | Classic | Classic / Terminal boot / Vela constellation / Prompt / Mascot / Off (`Appearance.SplashStyle`: `classic` / `terminal` / `constellation` / `prompt` / `mascot` / `none`) | Under Appearance → Window, with a live preview under the dropdown that uses the theme and accent being edited on the page; **takes effect on the next launch**. Windows only: the Dock bounce on macOS and the launch notification on Linux desktops already say "opening". Unknown values (hand-edited, written by a newer version) fall back to Classic |

- **Needed before the database opens**: the splash screen runs seconds before SonnetDB is up and cannot read the settings. Saving the settings
  mirrors the theme, accent, UI language and this item into `~/.velashell/startup.appearance` (a few `key=value` lines), and every launch aligns it
  once with the settings it read (no write when nothing changed) — the same approach as `render.mode`. The item takes part in cloud sync: it is
  a preference, not machine state.
- `VELASHELL_NO_SPLASH=1` turns the splash screen off (automated tests, screen recording, troubleshooting) and wins over the setting.

### 2026-10-19 Fourteenth batch (masking secrets in recordings and session logs)

Session logs and session recordings store the raw terminal output: the passwords and tokens printed by `cat .env`, `kubectl get secret -o yaml`
or `env | grep TOKEN` land on disk verbatim. A masking stage (`SessionOutputMasker`) now sits between the hook point both use
(`SshTerminalBridge.DataReceived`) and the recorders; the display path never goes through it.

| Setting | Default | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mask passwords and tokens in recordings and session logs | On | On / Off (`Security.MaskSecretsInCaptures`) | Under Security Audit → Session recording, below automatic recording; **applies to recordings and session logs started afterward**. The session log switch lives under General; masking covers both |

- **What is masked** (case-insensitive, erring on the side of masking): in `name=value` / `name: value` (JSON and YAML forms included; `grep --color` color sequences between the name and the separator do not get in the way) where the name contains password / passwd / passphrase / secret / token / api key / access key / private key / credential, only the value; the credential after `Bearer` / `Basic`; the body of PEM private key blocks (the BEGIN / END lines stay); tokens with a recognizable prefix (AWS `AKIA…` / `ASIA…`, GitHub `ghp_…` and friends, Slack `xox?-…`, `sk-…`). All become `***`. The current directory in `PWD=` is not a secret.
- **Bytes and lines**: every byte maps to one Latin-1 character before matching; rules and replacements are ASCII, so UTF-8 and GBK round-trip unchanged. Only complete lines are matched; the trailing incomplete line is held back only when it stops in the middle of a value (or inside a private key block), up to 4 KB, while `Password: ` prompts waiting for input and full-screen programs that never print a newline pass through immediately. Whatever is held is masked and released when recording stops.
- Not done: user-defined rules (meant to share a rule table with "custom highlight rules for terminal output", see `feature-plan.md`); bare values that are neither named nor prefixed (such as a lone base64 line) are not recognized.
