## Read in this order to write a plugin

1. [Dev guide](templates/dev-guide.md) — getting started, manifest, lifecycle, capability APIs, testing
2. [CLI manual](cli/cli.md) — every `vela-plugin` command
3. [Publishing](templates/publishing.md) — `.vpx`, signing, shipping to the marketplace
4. [SDK reference](sdk/sdk-reference.md) — contract surface and capability domains (look things up here)

The [plugin blueprint](plugins/) describes the **host-side** design and implementation. Read it to
understand why plugins look the way they do; you do not need it to write one.
